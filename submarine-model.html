<div class="post-body">Made a submarine for my next project roughly based on the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_941_submarine' target='_blank' class='link'>Russian Typhoon-class subs</a>. Some liberties were taken in the design compared to the real thing.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/submarine-model.jpg"><img src="../images/submarine-model.jpg" alt="Submarine model"></a><p>Submarine model</p></div><br>I've got a clear idea of a level to make featuring the sub. Need to figure out how to model sand.<br><br>I've had a ton of competing ideas lately and it's been difficult trying to figure out just what it is I want to build. My best bet is to concentrate on a single level and, now that I have several sources of inspiration and a bunch of notes written down, it shouldn't be too hard to put something together before too long. Going to stick to a first person perspective too to simplify things.</div></main>
