<div class="post-body">I had a weird dream where I ventured into this backrooms-like environment to rescue two other guys.<br><br>At the start I was watching this guy squatting in this drywall area that was reminiscent of the backrooms, except it was all plasterboard, plastic sheets and concrete, and it was very dim. After a while he ended up getting chased by monsters and seemed to get lost, then the monsters left and there was this loud thudding, like something really big was passing by.<br><br>Not long after, I could hear someone calling for help. It sounded like they were quite far away. I decided to head deeper into the complex to see what I could find. Eventually it changed to this bizarre Escher/Giger-esque labyrinth with claustrophobic corridors that went above and below each other with paths suddenly stepping up or down at random.<br><br>One passageway led to a sheer drop. There was also some kind of garden/courtyard inside some old 50s hospital or mental asylum made of red brick. It was terribly overcast. Then there was this small walled off area with two large ledges and a chasm in the middle that you crossed with long wooden planks. I encountered some of my IRL students (I'm a teacher) here, but lost them after we left the area. By this point I had found the two others who were following me around, but I'm not sure when that happened exactly.<br><br>There was a door there that when you opened presented another door, then another, and so on until there was a door with no handle. I knocked and it opened revealing another door. After a while of opening doors, I reached a point where there was a corridor on the left. It was lit up yellow and I think I could see something prowling behind a half-open door, so I turned to the guys and told them to go back. The main path seemed to be nothing but doors anyway.<br><br>Eventually we reached this area with an NYPD police car stuck in this cave made out of paper mache, but it was impossibly well-lit. We eventually found our way back through a kitchen cabinet, retracing my steps through the alien corridors and drywall area to reach what appeared to be a train station in London. We were in there for a month, but when we asked someone what the date was when we came out, only 5 days had passed.</div></main>
