<div class="post-body">12-29-23<br><br>It was a hot, clear day in the middle of summer and I was out for a walk around my neighborhood. The sun was starting to get low in the sky and I was taking a break from cleaning up the aftermath of a cookout. We had a large number of my family and other friends over for some event and the resulting mess was huge. Half way through my walk, I was approaching a corner of a block east to my house to turn south, and eventually west, to get back on to my street. At the corner was a white house that had a chain link fence surrounding the front yard to include the driveway (this house does not exist IRL).<br><br>Outside touching up against the fence was a pair of garbage cans. Inside the fence was a large grey dog. The dog was about the size of a great Pyrenees, but had little hair. It resembled a mix between a pit bull and a Doberman with short, sharp ears pointed towards the back of its head and patches of white on its underside. The dog was extremely curious with me since it must have smelled the garbage I had been dealing with back home which contained a lot of meat. It first stood up and leaned against the fence and barked loudly at me repeatedly as I was getting close to it. By this time the sun had gone down more and it was getting darker. I thought the fence was not nearly tall enough to contain that dog. Sure enough, once I got closer the dog climbed over it easily and ran up to me, barking.<br><br>I tried, and succeeded, to not run since there wasn't a chance I was going to outrun such a dog. This worked and the dog stopped before me, and began sniffing me while growling. I tried rubbing its head to calm it down, but it did not let me, snapping at my hand. It kept sniffing me until the sun was very low in the sky, though it did not stop growling aggressively at me. After a while, I got tired of waiting and wanted to go home, so I slowly began walking again to continue my walk. The dog was sniffing my heels the entire time I walked home. When I got home, the dog, which had followed me all the way back, got distracted by my trash can which had some bags with meat inside. While the dog was messing around with it, I decided to just clean up the rest of the mess in my backyard.<br><br>This turned out to be a very bad idea. The dog started running at me while barking extremely aggressively. Oddly, it would not cross over into my back yard. It simply remained at my back door where the backyard began, while unrelentingly barking aggressively. The dog wanted me since it completely ignored some trash bags that also had food, one of which was still open, that was next to it. I did nothing to see if it would stop its aggression, but night came with no change in its behavior. At this point, I felt I had no choice but to neutralize the dog, which I hoped I would not have to do. I got out, for some reason, a bow and a few arrows. I shot the dog in the chest five times, quickly. Oddly, the dog did not seem to have a pain response, or even notice the arrows sticking out of its chest. So I drew up another shot, aiming for its heart, and loosed the arrow. This arrow put it down instantly and with no cries of pain.<br><br>After a moment, I approached the dog to examine it, and noticed that it slightly glowed in the dark of night. Other than that and the 6 arrows in its chest, nothing was abnormal about it. I put the dog in its own garbage bag and was thinking about how to handle this situation. As I was thinking about it, I recalled a (not real) greentext titled ‘STALKER: Dog Of Chernobyl’ about an aggressive dog from Pripyat following some Russian soldier back to his quarters before he had to put it down as well. I thought about making a greentext of this event and sharing it on /k/, titling it STALKER: Dog Of Chernobyl 2. I went back to cleaning up the garbage. The smell from the bags was horrible from being left in the sun all day. While thinking about how this was a terrible day, I woke up.</div></main>
