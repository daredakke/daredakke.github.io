<div class="post-body">Came up with another rough whitebox level after thinking about what I want players to experience, that being the feeling of having to traverse a precarious environment with mistakes leading to long falls.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/whitebox-2.jpg"><img src="../images/whitebox-2.jpg" alt="Bridge leading to descending radio tower"></a><p>Bridge leading to descending radio tower</p></div><br><h2>Possible Progression</h2>You start in the top-left overlooking the tower, presenting an opportunity to study where you'll be going. Messages on the computer in your living space will go into more detail about what you have to do, likely something about routine maintenance on the communications equipment at the base (tip?) of the tower.<br><br>The bridge will be broken in the middle, meaning you won't be able to return that way once you cross it. There's a lift going between the tower ends but it's stuck at the bottom until you can reach it to fix it. An alternate path back to your living quarters can be found by venturing across another bridge to a path around the edge of the shaft. The level ends once you report back to your boss.</div></main>
