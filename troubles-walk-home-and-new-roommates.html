<div class="post-body">I was walking back home and saw an old friend's car, I called him and he got out to walk a bit with me. I told him that I wanted him to try on one of my (lethal company) masks because I wanted to see what got added with them. He first declined but accepted when I told him it was my first quota. He put on one of the mask and turned into a masked, which had buggy physics and kept bumping 5 meters into the air every time it touched the ground.<br><br>Anyway I kept walking home and soon reached it, (starting now I was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimeji_Simulation' target='_blank' class='link'>shimeji</a>) I approached the front gate to open it with my 3DS but saw Nee walking out, she told me that she needed to go and probably won't come back. (as in, moving out), I (shimeji) was very very sad about it and tried to persuade her to stay, but she was determined and would not stay, I burst into tears and give her the biggest hug I ever gave, telling her over and over again that I couldn't live without her and that she can't leave me. At that time 2 cars parked in front of my house.<br><br>After a short moment of heavy crying and whimpering, Nee patted my head affectionately and slowly I let go of her. She smiled, turned around and started walking away. At that moment I was back to my normal self, unsure when I turned back. My face was still covered in tears when out of the cars came my parents & my dog, my mother orally noticed that I cried but I stayed silent about it.<br><br>When we got inside our house we met a weird guy that apparently lived here while we were away along with his roommate mosquito which lived in a 2x2m space in the corner of the house. He tried to convince us that it didn't matter since he'd leave the house clean and spotless, so much that we wouldn't even notice he was her. After some arguing with him we decided to let him stay for today too.<br><br>The next morning my parents talked to each other about what to do with the guy, while I was listening to them from my bed, my father said we'd drop him in a snowstorm somewhere where he couldn't be found. My mom argued that people are found in snow biomes so that's a bad idea. My father argued back that they find people because they have a sign that asks for help and he wouldn't have that.<br></div></main>
