<div class="post-body">I'm on a plane with my mother flying back from some city. Apparently we're in business class but the seats are the same as economy. They're in a 2+2 configuration though so the aisle is very wide and there is plenty of leg-room. The windows are also like that of a train and I spend a lot of time staring at the passing landscape below. It's a clear day and we're low enough to make out streets and houses. I wonder what the passing towns are called and where we are.<br><br>The cabin crew come past with the refreshments trolley, but it has a large wooden trophy on top that contains ice for chilling drinks. It has some connection with cricket, perhaps the Ashes, but I don't know much about that.<br><br>The landing is strange. The plane comes to a complete halt about 2 seconds after touching the ground, but I don't feel any G-forces from stopping that quickly.<br><br>Some time later I'm taking another flight elsewhere, I think to somewhere around Saudi Arabia. I'm alone this time and it's early morning on a cloudy wet day. The sun is only just coming up so it's all dark blue outside.<br><br>There are very few people on the plane with me. It's a different operator from British Airways and I'm looking forward to seeing the difference in service. A couple occupies a small cabin to my right with a small mattress that barely looks enough for one person. I didn't know such things existed on planes. How long will this flight take anyway?<br><br>The plane starts moving, but instead of going to the runway, it starts wandering the terminal which is conveniently open-air. There are quite a lot of people around but they don't seem to notice, especially when it joins a queue at a coffee shop. I guess the pilot wants something before we head off.<br><br>I learn that the engines automatically shut off when people are close to them when some nearby women are startled by the beeping the system makes.</div></main>
