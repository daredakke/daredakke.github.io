<div class="post-body">08-05-2025<br><br>I was convicted guilty of causing some grave tragedy, and I got sentenced to so many life sentences that it would outlast the heat death of the universe. The court system, to get me to actually carry out the sentence, determined that I was to be somehow embalmed/preserved, but alive and sedated in a way that I was effectively immortal.<br><br>Before they did so, they spend a final day down in a rather well furnished room with any amenity I could want. I didn't help myself to anything as I was just dreading the upcoming eternity. I just lied down in bed aimlessly staring off into space, not even really thinking about anything.<br><br>First thing next morning, government officials entered the room and gave me the final choice to undergo the preservation process with either my eyes open or closed, as I would not be able to move anything once the process was complete. I chose to have my eyes closed (or rather, I just lied in bed with my eyes closed and not responding to them). Then there was nothing. It was like the dream had ended, and I was supposed to wake up (I think?). Nothing (I think?) for so long I can't actually describe it.<br><br>Towards the end, however, there was a steady growing hum that at first I did not notice. All of a sudden, it grew in intenseness exponentially very shortly. Finally, after so long, I woke up.<br></div></main>
