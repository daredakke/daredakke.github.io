<div class="post-body">I had a dream I was traveling internationally and I kept missing my flight because I couldn't, or more like wouldn't pack everything up. Partly because I was running a party that didn't want to leave, partly because not everything would fit into my suitcase, but my parents wanted to leave and they were saying "we're leaving without you". And other odd details, like I hadn't finished cleaning the floor.<br><br>I think I stay behind and my family leaves without me and I embark on some underwater diving expedition where we discover that GPS signals are distorted and put you in the wrong place on the map, but only if you're in certain places on the map and only if you're underwater.<br><br>I plot this effect on a map, the map is a pseudo-cylindrical/oval projection but looks nothing like the actual Earth, the continents are all different, and (0,0) is directly over something resembling salmon's censor lake (a lake on Google Maps that used to have black rectangles in it, but no more). After taking lots of data we realize that it's all distorted around the center lines and has something to do with four points in the corners, but if you just apply a small scale correction while in the oval projection, it's mostly fixed good enough for flying.<br><br>I go to the airport and it's this giant indoor temple like thing with a glass ceiling, it's truly massive, it may be the whole world that I was just plotting on a globe. For some reason the stairs going to the top brings you to the cold north and I think there's a hotspring there so I make my way there. Before I can get there, some criminal escapes from security and the whole airport is thrown into chaos, I start parkour-ing around but end up taken hostage, or maybe I capture the guy I forget, and we make our way to a plane and escape together. I realize I've forgotten my suitcase of things.</div></main>
