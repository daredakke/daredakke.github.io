<div class="post-body">I had a dream that a bunch of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukumizu' target='_blank' class='link'>tkmiz</a>fits came over to my house to celebrate <a href='darkf.html' target='_blank' class='link'>darkf</a>'s birthday.<br><br>Everybody brought their own chair to put in my living room, like full on recliners, someone even brought their pet miniature camels that were about chest height. The camels would walk up to you and lick your fingers if you weren't watching them.<br><br>It was weird though because darkf did not look like darkf at all but I knew it was him, but <a href='woland.html' target='_blank' class='link'>woland</a> and <a href='daredakke.html' target='_blank' class='link'>dare</a> were there and they looked like themselves. and other people were there that I've never seen and I never looked at their faces but I could tell who they were.<br><br>The atmosphere felt kind of gloomy even though we were celebrating a birthday so the weird camels helped to lighten the mood a little bit. They were just wandering around my kitchen and people would give them scraps as they walked by.</div></main>
