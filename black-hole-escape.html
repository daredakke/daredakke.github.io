<div class="post-body">It started as me playing gravity rush with aquoot and I was showing him how you could make black holes and destroy everything. The game was set in some city like New Orleans for some reason. I made five black holes and shot them into space and the we watched as they slowly came back down towards where we were and then they started sucking up the whole city block we were on.<br><br>At this point it stopped being a video game and we actually were trying to escape from this building-sized black holes that were swallowing up the block we were on. We managed to climb a building and get out of the way and when we came back down only the ground was left, there were no more buildings are streets on the block. Then we came back the next day and saw that a forest had grown there so we started exploring and we noted that there were ATV tracks in the mud in the forest which struck us as odd because the forest had only been there for a day.<br><br>We kept walking and then eventually ended up in a giant underground cavern that was probably 10,000 square yards and the ceiling was around 60 ft high or so. We walked to the edge of the cavern and found a small hut made out of clay that was probably barely large enough for a person to fit inside if they were curled up into a ball. At this point I explained to aquoot that that was my hut and that I was a hobbit and that I liked to live underground and dig and then I invited him inside. He went inside then I was about to follow him but the entrance to the hut was so small that I felt claustrophobic and stayed outside. Then I woke up.</div></main>
