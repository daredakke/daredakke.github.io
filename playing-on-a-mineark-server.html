<div class="post-body"><br>I was playing on a mix of Minecraft and ARK server, I did a good amount of leveling up and got good gear only to realise I was playing under <a href='woland.html' target='_blank' class='link'>woland</a>'s name for some reason (he was the server owner), so I went to watch how my actual character was doing and it was lacking behind a lot, very little exp and gear.<br><br>So while I was thinking on how to transfer that exp and stuff I got on woland's account, two random people in chat asked me who I was, I was surprised because I had never seen them before in that #tkmiz MineArk server, but they said they have been playing here for a while and never saw me, they were somewhat aggressive. Them saying that made me realise my gaming break must have been much longer than I thought.</div></main>
