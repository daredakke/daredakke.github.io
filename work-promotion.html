<div class="post-body">I was at work doing work stuff when my manager asked to see me urgently, so I followed him and he made me came to the system administrators office (there were like 12 of them). They were all working normally while I was seated with my manager who told me he was extremely happy with my work and wanted to promote me to sys admin immediately and give me a big raise of 00U08.0$ an hour (the U is not a typo), and everyone at he office was cheering.<br><br>So me and my manager stood up, we shake hands and start leaving while still shaking hands, we were going super fast in the corridors like 10 meters per step, and I opened the door (still shaking hands) and got back to the normal helpdesk office. Me and the manager stop shaking hands and I turn to my former coworkers and spread my arms to give them a grand announcement; "I'm fired" I said jokingly because I wouldn't be working with them anymore.</div></main>
