<div class="post-body">This was a (probably) six-stage or more kind of multilevel dream, so I'm gonna focus on the parts that will be the most interesting.<br><br>The entire structure of the dream followed some kind of strange school day, with the opening two sequences at home, then a long school bus ride (which was going away from the school as if it were returning people at the end of the day, then became a field trip or something. Distinctly remember being on the wrong bus route and then the people around me slowly shifting into the ones I'd expect on the correct route, then ending up back at the school which itself had changed some after a few tests of strength along the way. A lot of people from my HS appeared in the middling parts of the dream.<br><br>Arriving at the 'new' school again after it's transformation, I remember walking around for quite a long time around the exterior of the buildings, surveying the layout. There were classrooms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 'M', each with four stations for students to work at. I was called to '4', which was the lowest level of a concrete building, half outside within the bounds of four concrete pillars descending from the floor above and half inside, with an abundance of tinted floor to ceiling windows peering out amid the concrete structural pieces. I was called to the indoor section, and at my table of four sat Majime (no glasses) and Shijima (+ megane). The characters appeared something between 2D and 3D, but in a way that was just... perfect instead of the horrific abomination that one pictures when combining 2D/3D. We talked a bit about the whatever the assignment was, but I remember being exceptionally distracted by how fucking cute Shijima looked in glasses. They were the boxy, thick-rimmed kind, either black or dark blue (you know how color is in dreams) and somewhat rounded at the edges.<br><br>Then the world began to go crazy. A multitude of inflatable pillars burst from the floor, carrying me up to the ceiling along with some others, and a square TV, mounted in the middle of the room sprang to life. The broadcast consisted of this notably short, probably 2-3 foot tall mechanical creature with four arms issuing a challenge to defeat him in this side-scroller video game, while it played on two wide monitors at once, allegedly acting as the defensive game-master, taking on two challengers at a time as a flex of it's prowess. From that point on, I was seemingly sucked into the TV and played against the creature, tag-team alongside this individual who seemed to be my little brother (I don't have one) while many students spectated. The gameplay consisted of the player character, a black stick figure with a spiky head, lunging rolling and dashing over a variety of moving obstacles and hazards, attempting to reach the peak of this volcanic landscape. I remember getting close to winning and then messing around with the game and running out of time.<br><br>Then the sequence shifted into this broadcast of a chef who seemed to be streaming. He cooked a few dishes, soft boiled this enormous egg (could have belonged to a goose or an ostrich by its shape), then began smoking and just talking about things, before he began drawing on his face, his bed, the walls, with the burning cigarette's ashes, wiping it all over to create a network of spirals and other patterns with the chalky dust.<br><br>Then I wake. I should mention that earlier, when exploring the grounds of the 'new' school, by the entrance I did encounter Azu-nyan who also appeared 2D/3D, and I gave her a hug. Come to think of it, this is probably the first time I've ever had anime or manga characters appear in dreams before.</div></main>
