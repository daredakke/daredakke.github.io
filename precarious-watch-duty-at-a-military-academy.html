<div class="post-body">11-04-24<br><br>I was in some military training school, but not as a student. Instead, I was there to be security for the camp. One of our posts was on top of an extremely tall tower that could not be directly climbed to. To that end, there was a single narrow ladder in the wall near the tower that would place us near the top. From there, we would have to navigate sideways for a small distance using a chain link fence for support. Finally, crossing that, we would then simply haul ourselves over the ledge of the tower's post and relieve the current guards. After this though, one lucky bastard would get to climb further up to the tower's spire as one of the watch-posts was up there as well. That lucky bastard was me.<br><br>I recall being bored out of my mind for the entire shift. Occasionally I'd look directly down and note how I couldn't even make out people from this height. Most of the rest of the time was spent just looking out at a massive hollow mountain near the camp. The mountain had gigantic holes punched through it. Eventually I noticed the oncoming guards coming to relieve us. Since I was the highest one up, I was also the last to start my descent. After the last guard in my group finished crossing the chain link fence and made it to the ladder, the fence's upper supports gave out and caused the fence to lean forwards. Luckily this is accounted for and there are some slight footholds below the fence. For hand grips I had to use the ledge of the wall that the fence was embedded into. My palms were incredibly sweaty, but I managed to get to the ground safely. After getting some food with my fellow guards, I headed home to my hairless hare.<br><br>I had adopted a wild rabbit, or hare. It was abnormal in that it had no fur. I came across this hare near the mountain among a group of other hares that had mushrooms embedded into their skin. Since this hare could not grow anything on its skin, it was being ostracized from its group. So I captured it and took him home.<br><br>His skin was insanely smooth and oily to the touch. My dogs left him alone since they were scared of him for some reason (they are massive wusses irl lol). The hare would love to roam out behind the house chasing the dogs down or exploring the area. I was picking him up to give him a bath when I woke up.</div></main>
