<div class="post-body">It droned on for some time before entering the realm of conscious thought, the detail most apparent during that segment was that I was accompanied throughout the journey by the tubby asian girl.<br><br>(Enter, the conscious part of the dream)<br><br>I was in class, something nondescript between a middle and high school style classroom, sitting at a desk situated within a table-group opposite to the windows. Someone had earlier set me up with a 'pack' (looked much like a pack of blunts or cigarettes by the packaging, although it had clearly been assembled by hand) of mushroom joints, which within the laws of the dream were a bunch of mushroom bits contained within a reflective wrapping paper, much like a gum wrapper, covered in inky zigzagging patterns.<br><br>While still in class, I lit up two of them and smoked before attempting to conceal the still-smouldering wraps within my pocket, in hopes of dodging the teacher's notice. I had to repeatedly get up and dump ashes into the trash can (since for some reason, the mushroom-joints would not go out, despite not causing anything else within my pocket to immolate), and eventually the presiding authorities of the school ordered 'someone' after me, prompting me to flee the scene.<br><br>My pursuer was someone I knew in life - an assistant martial arts instructor with a heart of gold, who came to suffer a terrible fate. In truth, what pursued me took only his shape, not his voice, instead opting for a nasal and terrible tone, nearly cackling with every word, and as it taunted and called after me, jeering that escape was impossible, and that it knew everywhere I could go, my walk escalated into a run towards the direction of home.<br><br>Upon arriving at some amalgamation of many places I've lived, I ventured within, steadily locking the door behind me, and traversed the hallways before arriving in my room. While it remained out of sight, the jeering continued, prompting a sense of unease even within the area of perceived safety, which soon compelled me to raise the blinds in order to check the front yard. My corner-room had two walls equipped with adjacent windows, and as soon as I raised the rightmost blind, I saw IT, hanging upside down against the window, it's vacant eyes nearly meeting mine.<br><br>I lowered the blind once more in a flash, while what appeared as the instructor leapt off of the house and behind a nearby hedge, informing me in an awful screech, again, that there was nowhere I could run to, in hopes of escaping it. In a last ditch attempt to ditch the aberration, I conjured as much strength as remained in my legs and ran out the back door, abandoning that sanctuary for the devious uphill path that existed to connect my property and the neighbors.<br><br>It began covered in leaves, and the trail was impossibly long for how much space it took up in the overworld, gaining in incline as the path progressed, until all that was left was a steep slant of dirt surrounded by young maple trees. As I climbed the mud-covered bluff, I continued to lose possessions behind me, until I was entirely naked nearing the top of the mound, holding only for some reason an electric toothbrush, which I'd been using to stab into the hill for traction in the ascent. Looking back down, I saw the tubby girl not far behind me, along with some sort of transparent, opaque cat spirit floating in the air. In that moment I realized that those two did not truly exist in this world like I did.<br><br>Further down, while the pursuer's calls could still faintly be heard, it did not appear as the instructor, rather instead a sizable onyx-colored snake with silver accents on its neck coiled it way out of the forest, behind the girl and her spirit. After I looked into the snake's eyes, something was said (possibly by the girl?) , and I received a brief vision of the words "WHOLE" and "STORY" below one another, completely capitalized and covered in a number of odd faces, like one might find on a totem pole or a daruma. I saw one final entity of the type, and then awoke.</div></main>
