<div class="post-body">I dreamt that someone was showing me how to type a specific symbol on my computer's word processor. Usually you do that by typing ctrl+alt+a bunch of numbers, but he explained to me that they'd run out of numbers since there were too many symbols. So what you had to do to get symbols now was type in R+N+G and you would get a random symbol from the unnumbered bank of symbols, ideally the one you wanted. You had to keep doing the command over and over until you got what you needed.</div></main>
