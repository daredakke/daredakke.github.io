<div class="post-body">I've been thinking about what I want to do following the <a href='https://hatenasoft.itch.io/ssr-drainage-diorama' target='_blank' class='link'>ssr diorama</a> I finished in early October. I want to follow a similar pattern where the player moves around a variety of 3D levels with light interaction mechanics inspired by the likes of Yume Nikki and Disillusion ST. It should be a dream-like experience where you don't know where you'll end up next or who you'll be talking to.<br><br>To that end, I've started a new Godot project and modified the player controller to have a third-person camera thanks to <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@MajikayoGames' target='_blank' class='link'>Majikayo Games</a>. It's in good shape but I need to look into creating 3D characters and animations next, not just for the player but NPCs too.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/third-person-test.jpg"><img src="../images/third-person-test.jpg" alt="Simple third-person camera"></a><p>Simple third-person camera</p></div><br>If I can get the core mechanics sorted soon, I can then focus on creating interesting environments and interactions. I have a ton of ideas written down, some inspired by the dream logs recorded here. I'm thinking this project will take a while since it's not the only one. It's really an excuse to experiment and try new things.</div></main>
