<div class="post-body">08-14-2025<br><br>I was driving home from drill one evening, and saw that the road my house was on was completely torn to shreds and unusable by vehicles. So I ended up just walking the rest of the way home (What did I do with my car? Idk it just evaporated for all I know).<br><br>Part way through the walk, I stumbled across two kittens, a few weeks old at most. They came right up to me so I picked them up, and they each fit into the palm of my hands. I liked the color of their fur, white with an orange patch between their ears. Thus, I decided to put them into my cargo pockets and continued my walk home, with the kittens meowing the entire time. My final thoughts were ‘How am I going to keep the dogs from getting at them?’ Then I woke up.<br></div></main>
