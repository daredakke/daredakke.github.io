<div class="post-body">01-18-21<br><br>I was painting. I had been at church and a rude nun had taken money from me forcibly. Then we all went to the base for communion. On the way there I noticed paintings were being put up next to the door outside the church. When I got to where the priest was, everyone was painting. We weren't doing communion. We were to paint something we liked.<br><br>I didn't want to paint something depressing or edgy, but I couldn't think of something I liked for a while. Then I decided to just dump paint on the large sheet of paper I was given, which I folded in half. I started out with pouring grey water color paint (which looked kinda like charcoal shampoo) over the paper. I thought it was already looking edgy and depressing so I grabbed yellow watercolor paint. I had an idea to make a sun at the corner with it so I did. I noticed the grey paint had dried out, and the drying patterns looked like a city skyline. I then decided I would make this painting about me reading next to a window overlooking a city since I like reading. This was perfect, I thought. I do like reading.<br><br>I grabbed a pencil and started making the outlines of the buildings with their windows and balconies, and shading them to make it look like the sun was setting behind them. While I was doing this I was deciding which book I would depict myself reading. I decided to make the cover of the book that of The King in Yellow. The cover would be from the edition with the yellow figure with the red angel-like wings. Then I made the sky slightly purple to further indicate the sunset. Then I moved on to painting myself reading. I found that I quite enjoyed painting. Then I woke up.</div></main>
