<div class="post-body">I dreamt I was on wheel of fortune, but they played with one big set of puzzles (kind of like a crossword) instead of a series of puzzles, and everyone guessed letters for the entire board. Underneath each word there was a picture hint for them.<br><br>During the part where everyone introduces themselves I explained that I wanted to win a bunch of money so I could pay for a degree and become a librarian. There was a dramatic flashback of me playing around in an enormous library as a child, totally empty on the weekend, and thinking "boy, these guys don't have any work to do on Saturdays. This'd be a great job."<br><br>But the puzzles went on, and Pat Sajak got annoyed with me on my turn because I kept trying to guess consonants that were already used. Eventually they cut to a commercial break and I realized every consonant was used. When they returned everyone was given a chance to guess one of the puzzles. I had almost no money so they let me go first.<br><br>I nearly went with the Padme Amidala puzzle (which had a blue alien girl for a hint), but I went with the one that said "I don't wanna play any board games" (which had a fat sassy black lady for a hint) because it had a money bonus. After that the game ended and I spent time darting between hallways backstage to avoid people trying to talk to me.</div></main>
