<div class="post-body">The domain I've been using for the past 2 years is about to run out again and I can't be bothered renewing it, so I've moved all of the site's content into text files and wrote a little python script which constructs all the HTML from them. It's not like the site was ever anything complicated, I should have done this in the first place. At least I'll save domain and hosting costs from here on.<br><br>I simplified the design in a few places, like removing dates from dream entries since I didn't think it really mattered, while also improving it elsewhere, like the filters that let you see dreams from single authors. You could do that before but I feel this is clearer.<br><br>I don't think there's anything else to be simplified, changed or added so that'll probably be that.</div></main>
