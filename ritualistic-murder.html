<div class="post-body">The dream was about committing a series of ritualistic murders inside a hotel. As I approached the last victim, who looked just like grownup Anakin Skywalker from the prequels, he was surprisingly ok with it, but he wanted to take a shower first. I obliged.<br><br>When I came back, sledgehammer in hand, he was working out on a weight machine tucked between the shower and the wall. This made it hard to get a good swing at him. After a couple hits, he complained "ow, that really hurts." Then pointed out and said "you know you're going to get arrested, right?" Looking at the way he was pointing, I saw a police officer arresting someone on the other side of the bathroom. Apparently he didn't notice me trying to beat someone to death with a sledgehammer. At this point I thought to myself "oh, I'm in New Zealand." I thanked him for pointing the police officer out. "Yeah, I was wondering how long it would take for you to notice." I suggested taking this to another room. For some reason, he nodded and obliged. Then I woke up.</div></main>
