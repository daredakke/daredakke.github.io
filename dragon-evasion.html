<div class="post-body">It was from the perspective of a young man in his mid-thirties. He worked at what appeared to be an airport with a bunch of others whom he got on with rather well. Suddenly there was some kind of emergency and some of them are dispatched to get help from elsewhere. Turns out the airport was also some kind of research facility and a dragon (of all things) had escaped and was prowling around. It was feeling a bit like Evangelion at this point.<br><br>They all split up to go look for it and the MC and his friend began investigating one part of the town. It was all tight halls and passageways, enclosed bridges and alleys, a strange labyrinthine complex. The dragon took notice of the MC and began following him around, and though it was always on the outside of the complex they were sure its head would fit through the many windows and gaps. Unsure of whether it wanted to eat them or just being playful, MC and co began moving about all stealthily to avoid detection. It was quite tense, though the environment was pretty. It was daytime and there were many courtyards and gardens, like an eco-friendly Kowloon Walled City.<br><br>They encountered some new district but they couldn't enter because two guards at the entrance (a big lit-up archway) said they didn't have clearance. Pretty sure they where operatives who worked at a rival agency (think CIA). The evasion continued as they circled around. For some reason it was night now.<br><br>Things get strange. Something happened to the MC and he now has cancer and is now speaking to a camera in the hospital. He seems pretty bitter over the experience. The dragon, now looking a lot like Godzilla, is still looking for the MC. We can see out of the window that we're on the fourth or fifth floor of the hospital overlooking a vast car park. The dragon is on the other side next to another large five / six floor building - they're about the same height. Despite being so careful up until now, the dragon simply walks through the building causing great destruction.<br><br>Then the dragon dies off-screen and the MC recovers who goes on to perform a concert to a large audience. Not sure what the song was about but I remember he had an acoustic guitar. He either quits his job or also dies off-screen afterwards, can't quite remember.<br><br>I then had another dream where I was walking through a similar complex with a friend at night and I was recounting the first dream to him, not sure that's ever happened before. I was talking about how similar the environments were, then we walked through a door into a museum inside a large warehouse. I knew it was a museum from intuition though I had never been here before. We were a level up and there was a walkway that went around the edges and across the middle. I don't remember any exhibits.<br><br>A door on the other side led to a small room with a door that was ajar and some stairs going down. The door had a picture of a hooded figure above it and we surmised that this must have been facilities for some cult that was no longer here. I shone my torch into the dark room beyond the door to reveal a bedroom which slowly increased in brightness. I attributed this to our eyes adjusting to the light but it was like the ceiling light was on.<br><br>It was a concrete room with no windows and two beds. A strange plush toy emerged from under the bed and began flying around. It looked like an aeroplane. We spent the rest of the time exploring the room but didn't find anything of note.</div></main>
