<div class="post-body">I was at home and got called on my phone by one of you (cute small girl, slightly tomboyish, car painter). I missed the call and called back right after, where she picked up (I think she was called odie or Ody, or something like that - even my dream self couldn't remember her name). After some timid tsundere bit, she decide to come to my house.<br><br>Flash forward. She's in my house and we were being flirty even thought she was quite shy. After some times my parents decided to leave the house to go somewhere, they left and Ody and me were right at the window, where she said "your megane is quite far, maybe we should go at my place..." and at that moment blood rushed in my veins. I went up to my room to prepare (because I was just wearing shorts and a tshirt by that point) and did stuff. At that point my (in dream) grandpa took down the stairs smiling with a cocktail in his hand and summer party music emanating from himself.<br><br>Anyway I get ready, but friends, parents & ex-coworkers started having a party because I was going on a date (I think by that point my brain got confused because it never lived something like it). I was getting ready but couldn't find my shoes, I searched and searched but nothing. I tried some but figured they weren't mine but boots of someone else's.<br><br>At that moment some person in the crowd said that it's a festival (can't remember the name), and that my shoes may have been caught by the water floods, I looked around and saw the water rising and rising and peoples running towards it using inflatable floating bed as surfboard, I ran across the water to get back to my room, found my 3ds safe on a shelf. I kept looking for my shoes in the backyard and found a big monitor/TV. I used the smart motion detector camera on it to scroll it's content and an ex-coworker came. He tried to use a homemade laser pointer to scroll too but it didn't work as the camera detected fingers, not laser pointers. End of dream.</div></main>
