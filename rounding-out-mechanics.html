<div class="post-body">I've been spending a lot of time working on lore for the game's setting and I'm starting to pin down a story to tell. While I continue to work on fleshing this out, I've started finishing up the framework of the game so I can concentrate fully on content.<br><br>This includes things like a title screen, pause menu and moving between scenes including loading screens which are all implemented as of today. The next things involve a settings menu and coming up with a way to apply the correct reverb preset to noise-making objects in levels. I have a solution in mind for the latter but the annoying part will likely be coming up with all the presets.<br><br>Still, it feels good to be able to move between scenes now. Instead of having a bunch of really large scenes, I could opt for smaller scenes and save performance.<br><br>I really want this to work on low end hardware and am using my laptop as the minimum spec which uses an Intel Core i7-7600u with Intel HD620 integrated graphics. I don't think it'll look all that good but if it runs decently then I'll be happy.<br><br>That's all for January. Progress has been slow as I've have to take on more hours at work, but I think about this project all the time. It's rewarding to see it slowly come together.</div></main>
