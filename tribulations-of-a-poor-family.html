<div class="post-body">This is a retelling of a dream I had a while ago. Oddly enough I didn’t feature at all in the dream, I was more just watching the story, but still feeling the emotions of the characters.<br><br>There’s a very poor family with tons of children, at least 10. They live in a big house that’s been long abandoned, with peeling wallpaper and tons of water damage, the floor is rotted and the whole house is on the verge of collapsing. It seems to be during the Blitz.<br><br>Anyway, the oldest daughter in this family (she’s maybe 17) has a baby of her own, and it’s basically the one source of joy in the household. Everyone loves the baby, and she loves it most of all. She cares for all of her siblings and cousins while her parents and uncles are out at work.<br><br>One day work gets too thin, and there’s no money for food. The family sits around the table, destitute, but suddenly the eldest daughter brings out dinner. As everyone’s eating, they begin to wonder where the baby is. That’s when they realize what they’re eating. Everyone begins puking and crying and it’s horrible.<br><br>Then apparently my brain thought that this was way too fucked up because I had a flashback in the dream that revealed that the daughter was infertile and this fact devastated her, so her parents gave her a banana with Nutella on it and told her it was her baby, and she went insane and believed them. And everyone else had been going along with the lie so much they had forgotten as well. Despite this fact, the emotions for everyone were very real and I woke up in a panic.</div></main>
