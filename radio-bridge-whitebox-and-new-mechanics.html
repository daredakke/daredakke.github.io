<div class="post-body">Working on a possible level idea I had last night. All I seem to have lately are half-baked ideas so it would be nice to get something more concrete planned out.<br><br>So far I have this idea for an individual living in a megastructure like those of Blame! or Lorn's Lure. They'd reside a little ways outside of their community maintaining communications infrastructure. Perhaps supply chains rely on it, I'm still thinking of possible alternatives. Some things would break down and the player would have to travel around and collect various items to fix them.<br><br>I want the player to be able to interact with a lot of things lying around to learn more about the world as they wander about. It should also be a bit more than just a simple walking simulator with light platforming and perhaps more to contend with along the way.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/whitebox-1.jpg"><img src="../images/whitebox-1.jpg" alt="Megastructure radio tower bridge"></a><p>Megastructure radio tower bridge</p></div><br>Still need to find a place for that submarine. I'll think of something.<br><br><h2>Mechanics</h2>I've been working on fleshing out the game's mechanics lately with some promising results. It's starting to feel like a viable framework for making something with.<br><br><h3>Movement</h3>I've modified the first person controller I'm using to allow for some air control when you jump instead of being locked to one direction. Platforming feels a lot better now. Your head also tilts slightly left or right depending on how you're moving and it all works as expected with mouse and keyboard or controller.<br><br><h3>Sound</h3>Footsteps have been added along with a system to determine the level of reverb to apply to sounds the player makes depending on the surrounding environment. It could use some fine-tuning but I'm surprised my solution works at all. For static sound sources I'll probably come up with some reverb presets to run them through.<br><br><h3>Interactions</h3>Today I was also working on getting interactive objects working along with a crosshair and prompt on screen. Now I just have to make a dialogue UI and a sensible way to store dialogue without over-engineering something.</div></main>
