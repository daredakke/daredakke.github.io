<div class="post-body">06-21-2025<br><br>I was witnessing spider man movie where the spoder was in an orphanage, and he got adopted/bought by some handlers who knew of his powers. They gave him a spoder soot and sent him to raid a compound of sorts and apprehend the leader. Thing is, since Supaida man has a rule against killing people, he was taking too long. This resulted in his handlers sending in an elite swat team of sorts to just shoot the compound leader in the head. They then edited the bodycam footage to make it look like Spider-Man himself executed the leader. <br><br>Penis Parker was extremely upset at what the handlers did. Upon landing 'home', he met his true 'adoptive parent', some black professor X looking mother-squidder. Black X praised Spoder Man for his 'efforts', and told him to try and learn from the edited body cam footage. <br><br>Upon hearing this, Peter Pooper rushed the cripple, put his hands on his head, and nearly crushed it like Gregor Clegane did to Oberyn Martell. At the last moment, though, his no killing philosophy kicked in, and he just fell to his knees, sobbing. He was then escorted to a cell alongside plenty of other imprisoned 'heroes'. Among them was an extremely autistic elephant girl (?) whose trunk was blue, and also served as an actual penis. She spoke of some elephant diety that somewhat looked like her and lamented that most of humanity viewed it as a malevolent being. She closed the conversation by repeatedly singing that "he's a friend".<br><br>And then I woke up.</div></main>
