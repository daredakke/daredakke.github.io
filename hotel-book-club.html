<div class="post-body">I had a dream where <a href='monax.html' target='_blank' class='link'>monax</a>, <a href='woland.html' target='_blank' class='link'>woland</a> and I were in a hotel room reading books to pass time before we had to catch a flight somewhere. I was really enjoying whatever I was reading (it was some kind of sci-fi adventure) until I found out the prologue was unrelated to the rest of the book. Then after another contents page the first chapter turned out to be a single line and I lost all interest.</div></main>
