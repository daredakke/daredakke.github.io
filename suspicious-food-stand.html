<div class="post-body">12-04-24<br><br>There was a suspiciously operated Spanish food stand that also doubled as a sort of chemical storage facility. While I was working in the storage department, I came across a barrel of fat and lye that was left to react to make soap. I was to open the barrel and see if the soap had formed yet. Upon opening the barrel, however, I discovered that somebody had placed some tamales inside. This made me extremely confused. I reported the status of the barrel to the manager, who was taking orders from customers and giving them their food. He mentioned that one of the other workers promised that their taste would be improved by the bitterness of reacting soap and was eager to try them himself.<br><br>Another aspect of this business was the mascot. It was a dark furred monkey that the owner displayed in increasingly inhumane manners. At first, the monkey was just shown off doing his own thing and being an overall goofball. Then, for some reason, the manager decided to amputate its limbs, give it a lot of painkillers and opiates, and placed it in a pot to act as a sort of potted plant/monkey. Next, the monkey was further mutilated by most of its bones being removed and its body being trimmed so that its body could fit snugly inside one of the food serving trays. The monkey still had its neck and head intact, and would even make random cries from the tray while looking around in its heavily drugged state.<br><br>Finally, the owner somehow removed the monkey's neck and skull bones to make all of it snugly fit inside one of the extra small serving trays. Somehow, the monkey was still alive and had some reflexes, but was not nearly as active as even just before. The owner then told one of the staff members to put a small layer of Spanish rice over it and show it off as an example of the food served. In particular, he told the worker (by saying: 'Mu√©strasela wey') to show it to some woman the owner was flirting with. Oddly enough, the woman laughed and enjoyed seeing the monkey. Then I woke up.</div></main>
