<div class="post-body">I was playing a game like Lethal Company or one of those backrooms games with my friends monax and salmon, except it took place in monax's house that had become a maze of large, brightly lit, high-ceiling rooms. It was impeccably clean and uniformly lit somehow, and all the walls, floors and ceilings were made of the same smooth white material, like plastic crossed with plasterboard. I could also see out-of-bounds into the surrounding rooms for a while, but soon lost this ability.<br><br>We were in monax's room where he would occasionally fold laundry (there was a lot of laundry). Then we decided to head out. We caught sight of a baby that crawled out from behind a pillar down a long hallway and knew we were in danger. Strange soothing music played as we got near it. Moving past it quickly, it suddenly turned into a ring-tailed lemur and began jumping around and clinging to the walls. The music turned into a cacophony and we ran for it.<br><br>One room we ran through was a football pitch-sized labyrinth with very small waterways running across it. As we went, salmon kept trying to provide a conclusive summary to our experience like he was narrating a video essay but I kept cutting him off to give directions (sorry salmon!).<br><br>Then we entered another colossal room with large pillars evenly spaced throughout it. The wall to our left was missing, revealing an overcast cityscape that stretched on as far as the eye could see. I guessed we were in Tokyo about as high as the 25th floor. There was only one other skyscraper that I could see, the other buildings didn't reach up that high.<br><br>We rested near the edge after losing our pursuer, but I felt something else approaching. This turned out to be a dog, specifically an Alsatian, that I leapt across the room to reach (easily a 50 metre distance). Luckily it turned out to be friendly so I played with it for a while. Here the dream ended.</div></main>
