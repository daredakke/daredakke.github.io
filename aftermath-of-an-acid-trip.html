<div class="post-body">I was in my room after an acid trip and was staring at my monitor wondering if it had worn off or not. Guessing that it had, I decided to go to the living room. I walk down the stairs, but, before I could go through the door, I had to finish watching a video from my friend darkf, who was now a youtuber. I think the video was of him talking about his recent psychedelic experiences. The video was not on a computer, but floating in mid-air and see-through. The video ended with a list of patreon supporters that took like 3-4 minutes to complete.<br><br>So I go into the living room where my mum and brother are and they are visibly startled by my entrance. My mum asks "So why were you swinging around a chainsaw and dancing like you were playing a violin earlier?". It's clear I went a bit crazy during my trip, but I don't really know what to say aside from trying to gaslight them into believing it never happened, because I have no memory of it. Then it ended.</div></main>
