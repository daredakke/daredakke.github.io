<div class="post-body">I woke up late and the sun had been up for some time. I walked into my kitchen to see that it was thick with green sea fog outside. It had also been snowing a little. That makes sense, it was on the weather forecast yesterday. It was incredibly vivid and it was hard to see anything through it. I decided I'd get my phone to take a picture and went back to the living room.<br><br>Phone in hand, I started looking out my living room window as it's much larger when I noticed my flat was on the ground floor, but that's not right as I'm on the third. Am I in the wrong house? Then I woke up.</div></main>
