<div class="post-body">12-22-19<br><br>I watched a short YouTube video called whale.avi. The video was of a whale cry that got progressively louder, bass heavy, and just generally unbearable. Gets to the point where the sound waves themselves from the video violently shook me. It was an excruciating 30 seconds.<br><br>The video itself depicted poorly rendered cg models of cetaceans starting with a dolphin. As the sound got louder, the model would morph into another cetacean. I remember seeing a blue whale, an orca, and a sperm whale. The sperm whale appeared alongside the worst sound.<br><br>Also, I watched the video with my bluetooth earpods, which meant the effects were worse. I tried reaching for them but the vibrations emitted from the video were so bad I couldn't move after a few seconds. I woke up violently shivering, which then became mild sleep paralysis.</div></main>
