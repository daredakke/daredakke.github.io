<div class="post-body">I'm in a large city on a trip, perhaps London, leaving a hotel I checked into only an hour ago but there are no stairs or escalators to reception, only a steep rough slope. I slide all the way to the bottom but crash into the floor, apparently this is common. The walls surrounding the reception on three sides are large floor-to-ceiling glass windows with revolving doors in the left and right walls. On speaking to the receptionist I learn that I can't take my room card outside but he gives me a temporary replacement that is an A4 sheet of flimsy plastic. I leave via one of the revolving doors.<br><br>I'm walking through the overcast city streets, going nowhere in particular. The paved streets and stone buildings are very tidy and clean cut. I find a shopping arcade and wander to the store at the back. There aren't many windows and everything is dark. The walls are black with blue and purple light everywhere. A row of computers with CRT monitors where you can sit down and play PS2-era games are tightly packed together on my right (kind of like a pachinko parlor) while glass cabinets containing a myriad of figurines and other gaming paraphernalia are on my left. The aisle between them is narrow, barely enough for one person, and gently curves away to the left ahead of me.<br><br>The end is a dead-end so I make my way back and find an emergency exit. This place is cool and all, but there's nothing I want there. I step back out into a back alley, but it's somewhat open with a large plaza among several tall buildings. I see only one other person wearing a slim-fitting suit who I follow. He breaks into a run and it's hard to keep up. He curves to the left and, seemingly on purpose, slides into a large but shallow pool of water. He takes off his suit jacket as he gets out and we walk over to the entrance of a building, but I don't remember what it was for.<br><br>Later I find myself on the train home and watch the city go past the window, it's really interesting for some reason. The train slows as it approaches a major station with a large road intersection outside. Then I wake up and remember that I'm actually flying back. The woman to my right says I've been out for a while and that she misplaced the complementary bottle of water the crew handed out to everyone. I was at the far-left window seat during this conversation, but when it ends I'm just to the right of the right-most aisle. The seats are in a 3+3+3 configuration, this must be a big plane.<br><br>Suddenly the plane starts diving and twisting and turning, it feels very strange. Many passengers start screaming. The pilot states calmly over the intercom that the plane will be losing altitude for the foreseeable future, but I can only interpret this as the plane crashing. I find it hard to believe that this is actually happening considering how unlikely it is. The feeling of finality and dread stayed with me for a while after waking up.<br></div></main>
