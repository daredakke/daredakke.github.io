<div class="post-body">I was in a work meeting but I wasn't paying much attention. I remember my boss talking about a new method of travel where you jump and hold right mouse button to fly but I didn't think much of it at the time. The workplace did not at all resemble my real-life workplace. There was no ceiling, just an endless blue void filled with stars.<br><br>After the meeting I had nothing to do so I went to see some awards ceremony and got talking with this older lady at the back which was far more interesting. She was giving me advice on how not to care too much about the job when this young Asian woman dressed in fine yellow-orange silks came over and asked if the taste tester for the Emperor was around. That was me, so I excused myself and followed the young woman. Incidentally, she had an assistant dressed in a similar way except coloured pink.<br><br>I stopped partway to wash my hands in a restroom. On exiting, I decided to try that method of flight from earlier. To my surprise it works, though it was more like gliding. You would jump and holding RMB would lock your height. I discovered that you gained height over time and that sticking out a limb in the direction you wanted to move would accelerate you in that direction. I ended up moving fast enough to overtake the young woman I was supposed to be following.<br><br>I arrived at a garden party where the Emperor was at a table at the back, though I could only see his wife who had long blue hair that was slowly greying. I wasn't really sure why they called him "Emperor" since he was really just the US president. I realised that I was quite disheveled, like I had just rolled out of bed, so I began combing my hair despite an aide saying I shouldn't.<br><br>I was presented with a Halo-themed cake to test that his wife seemed nervous about and chestnuts of various sizes. I examined the chestnuts closely but ended up dropping a few, not that anyone seemed to mind. The dream ended about here.</div></main>
