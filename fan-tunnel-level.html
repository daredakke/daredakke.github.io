<div class="post-body">Put together a level I would like to see in the final product in some way. While I have a bunch of worthwhile assets already, I feel like I'm going to need a lot more to give these places character, otherwise it just comes across as a slightly more interesting whitebox.<br><br>There's a balance to be struck for the sake of gameplay of course, but I want as much of the level to feel like it has a purpose as much as possible. Then again, you can get away with a lot of nonsensical design when building levels set in an incomprehensibly large and complex megastructure.<br><br>You start on the left side in the screenshot below and make your way towards the fan.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/fan-tunnel-3.png"><img src="../images/fan-tunnel-3.png" alt="From the far end"></a><p>From the far end</p></div><br>You reach this door thanks to a pipe bridge and then make your way back along the opposite wall.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/fan-tunnel-1.png"><img src="../images/fan-tunnel-1.png" alt="The fan duct"></a><p>The fan duct</p></div><br>One of these cranes lets you get down to a tunnel opposite the fan.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/fan-tunnel-2.png"><img src="../images/fan-tunnel-2.png" alt="Cranes over a chasm"></a><p>Cranes over a chasm</p></div><br>Once through the fan, there will be another area to explore. I'm not quite sure what this is yet, but I'd like it to be a bit brighter and open. Something to contrast the dark and claustrophobic environment of the tunnel.<br><br>I also made a small change to how death works. You no longer die if you hit a very steep slope, you now continue sliding down it which feels better, leading to longer falls.</div></main>
