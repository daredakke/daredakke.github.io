<div class="post-body">Added several new mechanics today while also fixing a bunch of bugs.<br><br>The first is a torch to light up your surroundings. Since the setting is a megastructure, it's unlikely that everywhere is well-lit. I feel like this will need fine-tuning and I might offset it a bit so it feels like it's being kept in a chest pocket or something.<br><br>I also turned the lights off in my test level and it feels pretty eerie.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/test-level-torch.png"><img src="../images/test-level-torch.png" alt="Torch lighting up a dark scene"></a><p>Torch lighting up a dark scene</p></div><br>The player can now die if they fall too far and respawn at the last checkpoint they entered. These will be placed before and after any tricky challenges to hopefully minimise frustration.<br><br>If the player is moving fast enough, they'll start to hear the wind rushing around them, becoming loudest at terminal velocity.<br><br>Levels can now have atmospheric sounds looping in the background which has its high end filtered depending on the openness of the player's immediate environment. This means that any background ambience is deadened should the player walk into a confined space.</div></main>
