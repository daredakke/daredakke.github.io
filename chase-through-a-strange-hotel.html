    <h1>Chase through a strange hotel</h1>

<div class="post-body">I was in a 4 floor hotel, seemingly in the afterlife, the hotel had no bedroom, no stairs and no exit, only lobby, corridors, an elevator, and a wide arrangement of stores and entertainment, plus a couple weird rooms. <br><br>A lot of the people in this hotel were sharply dressed, like mid-tier nobles of the middle ages. I was on the first floor of this hotel, not knowing anything about it. I took the elevator to the second floor, as soon as the doors opened I saw two women fight, dressed sharply as the others, they were in a rapier duel to death yet were still doing casual talk like it was normal.<br><br>One of them looked at me somewhat smugly and asked why I don't have a weapon, I understood that people in this floor were always dueling when interacting with someone else. I figured this floor was far above my skill level, so I went back to the first in fear.<br><br>I roamed around with my mom, and we entered a perfume shop to get one for me, but as I do not know anything about smells and have a hard time even differentiating any of their odors, we just spent time in the casino of the perfume's store. The casino was rather classical, tables to play cards and roulette but no machine to gamble by yourself. It was a rather pleasant ambiance.<br><br>We started playing with some of the residents, but my mom lost, and she died (well, re-died because we were in the afterlife), her body turned to a mix of stone, dust and crystals. I was shocked that it could happen and that it did to my mom, so I collected the crystals in a cart to remember her and bring them home. <br>I left the perfume store. <br><br>As I was walking around the lobby with the cart and my momcrystals, I got interrupted by some workers, in high-vis who took my cart and brought it in a room because it's what's done in this world. I got very angry that they would take away what left I had of my mom, so I opened the double door of the room in which they took her. <br><br>That room was big and open, almost looked like outside, with a big sea and piers, I saw the cart on one of the boat that was parked there and tried to get to it, but the workers here found it rude, got offended and refused to let me go. I sat there for a minute grumping, trying to think about what to do. I knew that apologising would have done the trick but I refused to do it because I had done nothing wrong. <br><br>I focused and jumped, ran, aggressively weaved through the workers to get to the boat, they tried and failed to stop me so they called security. Security was made of a SWAT team, not really SWAT but equipped and behaved like them. They shot at me which I narrowly dodged, but they managed to prevent me from reaching the boat with the cart containing my momcrystals. <br>I ran away, I got back in the perfume casino but they were still pursuing me, the other guests at the hotel were unbothered. <br><br>They scanned the room with the flashlights attached to their rifles, and I was hiding between the wall and floor (there was a vertical gap in which one could crawl to hide), but they found me so I ran away again.<br><br>In the lobby I opened a door, in a hurry I darted into it, this room was dark, and everything was black and white, or maybe my vision changed to black and white when I entered it. <br>This room was tight, but descended, a lot, it was kilometers deep. The descent was not pleasant as it was made of sharply angled wooden "bridges", maybe 120-160° (180° being vertical), so I kept falling and falling, hitting the walls and bridges until I reached the bottom, it was no bigger than 2x2m, with a single withered thin man, he looked insane and held his head in his hand.<br><br>He must have been stuck at the bottom of that room for an eternity, he noticed me and in his insanity jumped at me. He tried to bash my head with his crumbled fists like an undead, I didn't have the time to react so he pinned me to the floor, he was an actual threat. In a fight or flight response, I pushed him and he hit his back against the wall which was enough to knock him out due to his poor body state.<br><br>Above me I could see lights descending, the SWAT team was still looking for me.<br></div></main>
