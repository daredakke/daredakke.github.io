<div class="post-body">11-01-23<br><br>I was passing through and wandering around at some presentation/event fair. I went into this small conference area building because I had nothing better to do. I did not know what event was taking place inside.<br><br>The inside was a square area with light brown walls and a light brown thin carpet. Inside was set up a sort of computer lab with several PCs set up in groups throughout the interior. The main group for the leaders/presenters was simply a row of about 5 desks set up towards the back of the building facing the door. The groups for the participants were set up in a strange manner. They were just a set of four PCs on desks with rolling office chairs facing each other in a 2x2 manner. The strange part was that one of the desks in each group was in a depressed part of the floor about five inches deep. On top of that, these desks had a rather deep pit, about 2 feet deep, where the chair should be. Though, the way the chair was set for an unused desk it just barely touched the edge of the pit. To use the desk, one would have to slide a metal panel set inside the pit’s wall towards the top over the pit to close it.<br><br>For the event itself, it seemed to have no clear focus, or at the very least participation was not required if you just wanted to use a PC for other reasons since there were very few participants. I was told I could have a seat anywhere I wanted. I chose one away from the participating groups since I just felt like playing some vidya for some reason. Upon seeing the strange layout of the low desk, I chose to sit there, slid the metal cover over the hole and verified I would not fall through by standing on the plate before taking a seat.<br><br>I logged into steam and was contemplating on which of the five I apparently had in my library to play. While wondering, someone else had entered the conference hall and took a seat directly next to me. I looked over and saw a rather pale woman about my age and about 4’10” with shoulder length slightly wavy black hair. She seemed to be rather thin from a lack of any significant exercise/activity. She was wearing a white short sleeve shirt and black shorts and had a red baseball cap with no discernible design on her head.<br><br>We greeted each other with a ‘hey/hello’ exchange. And I went back to looking at my screen intending to not pay any attention to her. She must have been confused about the really strange desk layout because she was staring at my desk for at least a minute before commenting on how strange it was, to which I agreed and explained the pit I was sitting over. Then she took a look at my screen and amusingly scoffed, commenting on how she thought it was funny how I was logged into steam rather than participating in the conference. I mentioned how she probably wasn’t gonna participate either since the area of the conference hall we were in was quite far away from the people participating, to which she did not say anything to.<br><br>She took a closer look at my screen and was reading my library of games. She saw a VN I had (I think DDLC+ ?) and mentioned how she had wanted to get it but wasn’t sure it was worth getting over the free version. I said I liked it which led to her asking if she could play it a bit. I let her take my desk and mess around a bit with the game. She sat cross legged on my chair and I thought she looked cute. While she was doing that I took the seat she had originally sat in and we spoke some more. Eventually we both quieted down some as we were reading the text. Somehow she was good at the game, which made no sense to me even in the dream since it was a VN.<br><br>At some point I got tired of sitting and looking at the screen from an awkward angle and I sat in the chair with her to read the screen better, as well as just be up against her. She did not mind in the slightest and actually seemed to enjoy the company. We spoke more, getting to know each other. I recall her name starting with an ‘A’ and including the letters ‘N, T, and Y’. After finishing a section/chapter she wrapped up the game and closed out. She then asked if she could show me another favorite VN of hers and I said ‘sure’. She logged into her steam account and we proceeded to read a chapter of another VN together. I do not understand how someone can be good at a VN since I thought it was impossible due to their structure, but she was. Eventually the event in the hall was closing up and we both had to go.<br><br>She said to add her on steam since she forgot to write down my username. Her username was an anagram of her name, still starting with an ‘A’. We both had to leave since the event leader was waiting to lock the door so I just wrote her username. Then we exchanged phone contact info and we split off. I woke up at this point.</div></main>
