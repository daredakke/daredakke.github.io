<div class="post-body">Spent last night and this morning putting together a simple environment. It's nothing big, just a large chasm with a narrow bridge you walk across, more of a transition if anything, perhaps a break between platforming sections.<br><br>It's good practice for seeing how the game could feel too.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/bridge-room.png"><img src="../images/bridge-room.png" alt="Chasm with bridge crossing it"></a><p>Chasm with bridge crossing it</p></div><br>Creating the level out of larger meshes helped uncover a small bug with my dynamic reverb system where raycasts were basing their distance off of the centre of the mesh rather than the point of collision. Not sure how I missed that but little details often slip through the cracks.<br><br>Other recent work includes adding coyote time that allows the player to jump in the 10 frames after moving off a surface into the air and tweaking how player death works. The dialogue UI and logic are now functioning too, I just need to figure out aesthetics but that's a problem to solve later on.</div></main>
