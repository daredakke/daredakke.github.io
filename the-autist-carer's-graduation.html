<div class="post-body">There was some earlier events were I was trying to find the room for a university lecture about economics. The first part in a clear sequence of events had me working as a sort of caretaker for an autistic girl. I couldn't say whether it was some kind of student work or a professional position, just that it was my "job."<br><br>She was high school aged and appeared to be at the university for some sort of school event. The girl had a fixation with water and I was trying to get her out of a swimming pool and send her to bed, as it was getting late and her program itinerary's time for sleep.<br><br>I managed to talk her out of the pool and guided her to the assigned sleeping quarters, a very long room with single beds all in a row, reminiscent of a barracks. At this point she's just clinging on to me and I walk about halfway down to what I *think* is her designated bed. After drying her off and changing her clothes I'm just waiting for her to let go of me so I can get her to sleep do something else.<br><br>I ask if this is even her assigned bed and she finally lets go and jumps into the one right next to it. This relieved me, as 1. if she was in one of the "normal" girls beds, they would likely have yelled at her 2. if she got yelled at for that, someone would likely yell at me later.<br><br>Regardless, my responsibilities here are finished and I promptly leave. My first order of business is to find a dryer for the towel. They are all in use from other participants on the trip, so I throw out all the clothes in one that seems finished and throw the towel in. A counselor I don't recognize asked me where I got the towel, and I claim I "just found it laying around", hoping to minimize responsibility on my end, in case anything I had been doing violated protocol.<br><br>At some point it became morning. It was time for graduation and the university was shutting down. I exited the building from the front to see a completely crowded parking lot. I didn't see the trip bus anywhere, but I didn't feel much need to rush.<br><br>Apparently, I'm graduating too, because my family is here to see me. My brother pulls up alongside me and starts ranting about how he drove all this way in the Arizona heat to buy a new car and they wouldn't sell it to him and now his OCD is acting up and etc. He drives off to find a parking spot.<br><br>My father, mother, and a different brother pull up in a van. I ask them if they know where the the bus is (other side of the building, apparently). I take this brother into the building for a quick tour while my parents park; I feel there's plenty of time.<br><br>When I get back into the building there's a massive cleaning operation ongoing since the campus is shutting down. I plan to show my brother some of the labs I work in (the building is 86 stories) but all of the elevators are being "cleaned" or something.<br><br>I find one that's still operational and we enter. It quickly becomes crowded with other people, so my brother transforms into a handbag to avoid interacting with the crowd.<br>My lab is one the 44th floor and when the elevator opens there is a reception desk in front of us. The receptionist tells us that the total fee for this elevator use is $20.46. Everyone else quickly lays money out on the counter and my brother transforms back and hands $1.80 to the receptionist for our part of the fee. <br><br>I quickly realize that my brother did not use his own money, but rather swiped someone else's from the counter and presented it as his own. I decide the best course of action is to pretend not to notice and quickly exit down the hall with him, to avoid drawing unnecessary attention. However, the lab is actually on the next floor. As we take the stairs up, strange noises can be heard coming from lower levels of the stairway.<br><br>I remember that everything that has occurred so far is beat-for-beat exactly like a movie I once watched. The noises coming from below are undoubtedly government dispatched "sword dogs"^* here to kill me and cover up information on the projects I was involved with. <br>I make a break for the lab with my brother. Our only hope for survival is to activate the "DeusMaker 3000", a targeted decapitation satellite network. I was involved with programming the network before the government shut down and disavowed the project. As I recall, the project’s scope had once been leaked to the public, and Arnold Schwarzenegger threatened to kill himself if such an inhumane device was ever used.<br><br>There should be enough time to bring the satellites online and adjust the system to target our pursuers, I think that should buy us enough time for now.<br>That's about when I woke up~<br><br>^* the "sword dogs" are literal dogs carrying swords in their mouths</div></main>
