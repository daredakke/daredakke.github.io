<div class="post-body">09-28-24<br><br>I was like 12 and my cousin was over. He wanted to use my PC to play a browser game that he wanted to show me, and then hold a competition. The game was complete nonsense with random but easy tasks. The score recorded was actually the time you wasted doing essentially nothing. My cousin wanted to see how long he could trick me into wasting time. He told me I wasn't allowed to look since it would give me an advantage, and started the game.<br><br>He lasted around 20 minutes, pretending to make it look like the tasks are very hard. Upon finishing, he saw that someone else had played the game on the PC for longer than he had, at least an hour. So he started over, this time playing for two hours with the hopes of tricking me into wasting the entire day beating his 'score'. Once he was finished, he told me it was my turn and that I would not be able to beat his score. When he showed me the site, I said I had already done this trick to my brothers, and that I already knew the game was a prank. He then proceeded to cry out of frustration since he was ultimately the one who got indirectly tricked into falling for the prank he wanted to pull on me. Then I woke up.</div></main>
