<div class="post-body">I had a dream about waiting for a flower arranging workshop to start in the back of a Walmart where they keep all their chairs, including these uncomfortable metal folding chairs that were listed as orthopedic back supports. I thought about buying one but it was really expensive.<br><br>Most of the people left but I kept waiting. I was stuck talking with a girl who I recognized as my brother's ex-fiancee (who does not exist in reality). She had a fetish for pretending and dressing her partners up as babies, which led to break off their engagement. She seemed interested in me now, which was concerning.<br><br>The instructor finally came, but they just wanted to sell chairs so I left. The pouring rain made it hard to see and I nearly drove into the mailbox which was mounted in the middle of a turn lane onto the city bridge.</div></main>
