<div class="post-body">03-09-25<br><br>I was 'playing' Elden Ring with Eggy and someone else from the channel. We were split up around an area that was a combination of Caelid and Mt.Gelmir trying to discover flask upgrades and level up fragments (renamed Scadutree fragments). The sky was overcast with rather bright red and yellow clouds that did not mix. While emerging from a fir tree forest into a clearing, a really strange ancient dragon flew down and began spinning around the area like a spin-top. It went down with a few strikes. Afterwards, Eggy had to leave.<br><br>I continued into the clearing to discover a dilapidated building that was a mix between a museum and a church. Halfway up the floors was a wooden display case with rocks. Rather than outright grab the rocks, I inspected the cabinet further and took a look at the back since it wasn't fully pushed up against the wall. There I found some small drawers going down the length of the cabinet underneath two larger drawers at the top.<br><br>Opening the first wide one, I found more rocks carefully placed into small felted squares. Touching a coarse blue rock to pick it up, I heard a faint voice from nowhere in particular. The voice said 'lapis.' I dropped the rock back down and touched it again, hearing the voice slightly louder this time. Next to the lapis rock was a pale, grainy and rather fragile rock. When I touched that one, I heard a loud screaming.<br><br>I moved on to the rocks on display. The more interesting ones were on the top shelf and included a piece of jade, a piece of polished obsidian, and a large uncut emerald. Touching the jade did not yield a voice. Touching the obsidian, I heard a voice reciting something in Latin about ravens. It ended its speech with 'Pimbom piambom' and began to repeat what it had said. When I tried touching the emerald, I ended up also touching the jade at the same time. One of their voices (likely the Jade) noticed that they could hear the other (likely the Emerald). The two then began a brief conversation in an extremely quiet tone that was just quiet enough that I couldn't make anything out. They then fell silent for some time, so I let go of the Emerald and instead touched the Obsidian with my other hand. The Obsidian's voice was still reciting it's speech, though it was not at the same part I left it off at. If the Jade heard the Obsidian's voice, it said nothing. The Obsidian kept on with it's speech and I let go of both to further inspect the other compartments of the display case.<br><br>On the side of the case was a small door which opened up into a compartment with a piece of clothing. Touching it, I heard a voice of what I thought was the final thoughts of its owner before it was discarded. The voice said something along the lines of it being too hot to wear this (Mt. Gelmir is a volcano), and that it was a shame he'd have to discard it. Then I went behind the cabinet again and opened the upper left compartment door. I found more clothes there, but it was a bunch of women's underwear. I was genuinely baffled, but the curiosity got the better of me and I pinched a pair of black ones by the elastic band. I heard a generic anime girl screaming as if she were embarrassed at someone seeing her change and shoving them into the compartment. I found this hilarious and confusing at the same time as there were two other pairs, a blue pair and a rather dirty looking white pair, and wondered about their origins. The hilarity woke me up.</div></main>
