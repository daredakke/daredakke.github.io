<div class="post-body">Been working on some basic models with crunchy low-res textures. I've decided not to be too particular with textures, kind of like how it's done in Lorn's Lure. I put together a simple environment below with some of them, mostly to see how the platforming feels with representative models. Seeing this slowly come together really gives a sense that I'm making progress.<br><br><div class="body-image"><a href="../images/test-level-2.jpg"><img src="../images/test-level-2.jpg" alt="Test environment"></a><p>Test environment</p></div><br>I refactored the way materials are handled which was long-overdue as well as simplifying the footstep code which now takes into account player speed, so walking slower results in taking fewer steps which feels better in general. Now I need to work on interactive objects and dialogue.</div></main>
