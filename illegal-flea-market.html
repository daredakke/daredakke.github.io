<div class="post-body">01-03-25<br><br>I was in a city far from where I live to go shopping. While I was there, I planned to go to an illegal flea market since my uncle asked me to get him some cigars that are only sold there. To access the flea market, I had to rent a cheap motel room. When making the reservation, I made sure to ask for a room with green walls, since those are the only rooms with entrances to the market.<br><br>Once I got to the room, I shut the blinds and made my way to the bed's headboard. I pulled it sideways to the right of the bed to reveal a small tunnel with a green drywall interior that I could climb through just above the bed. I could not see the end of the tunnel since it had a sharp bend not too long into it. Upon climbing through the tunnel, I stood up and took a look around me.<br><br>I immediately noticed that the space did not look like the flea market that should have been there. The dimensions were the same as they should be, but there were no shops around. Instead, the space seemed to be an office with security cameras all over the place. Taking a look around at the cameras, it seemed that, thankfully, none of them were able to see me. I looked at some papers mounted on the wall, but couldn't make out many details before I heard voices approaching.<br><br>Quickly, I scrambled to crawl back through the tunnel before they got too close. Once I was back in the motel room, I slid the headboard back into its place and went to the receptionist and asked him what happened to the flea market. Apparently, the flea market was raided by federal agents and shut down for illegal operations, with the space being converted into a federal office. The receptionist was surprised there was still a way into the space in the motel as he was certain the feds had sealed every entrance except for a few not in the motel. Then I woke up.</div></main>
