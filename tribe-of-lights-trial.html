<div class="post-body">It began with me and many of my classmates taking a test known by some name that I can't exactly remember, although it was supposedly something similar to an IQ test that measured your worth as a human. One of the first questions was a riddle and went something like "my fields are blue and my sky is green - what am I?". For whatever reason, the answer turned out to be "a computer". In the early part, many of the questions were similar riddles, but there eventually came a strange question, which needed to be answered with another question, that being, "who are you?".<br><br>The test then answered my question. It showed some kind of emblem of a Cthulhu-like octopus head, like the guy from Pirates of the Caribbean. the thing then answered that it was an envoy of the "unseen cherubim," also known as "the primordial demon." It was apparently linked to some kind of original sin and had also been abducting humans since before recorded history, turning them into its evil servants.<br><br>The test I was taking was apparently part of a system created by "the tribe of light" which would allow my eyes or my soul or something like that to be able to see and comprehend the unseen cherubim and, in that, become a warrior and fight against it.<br><br>As I turned the next page, I was suddenly whisked away to a place resembling the top of a tower which I instinctively knew as "the world compendium". A balcony surrounded the perimeter and walls were on the other side of the balcony (I only got 5 hours of sleep and am not in a good condition to try to describe architecture). On each face of the internal wall was a portal that lead to an ancient time. The world compendium was apparently an archive created by the tribe of light that recorded every moment in human history around the world.<br><br>I was deemed to be ready to fight the envoy of the unseen cherubim, so I alongside some of my other classmates went through one of the portals and found ourselves on the roof of an apartment building. Facing us was the guy that looked like the octopus thing from earlier. A girl behind me to my right held an assault rifle aimed at the thing's head, telling me she was ready to fire at my call. But then the guy started monologuing.<br><br>He said that he would die if he could but he was immortal and went on to explain what would happen to him the moment the girl opened fire. He said that he would begin to approach and that as the first bullets hit they would sting like hell but, over time, he would eventually become numb and as he would wrap his tentacles around her there would be nothing but muffled impacts. The girl opened fire and that exactly happened.<br><br>I panicked and ran to the roof access door to try to escape downwards, but a mean old lady was guarding the way, so I ran to one side of the door before quickly doubling back as the old lady chased me. As I went down the roof access door, it lead right into the old lady's apartment for some reason. Panicking, I rushed outside of the apartment and into the balcony overlooking some kind of courtyard. The architecture of the complex was strange. It was essentially composed of two different buildings, although that wasn't visible from when I was on the roof.<br><br>There was an inner tower that was basically just a normal apartment building, but surrounding it was an outer wall of apartments, such that somebody on the balcony of the inner tower would be facing somebody at the front door of the outer wall. Hurriedly, I rappelled down the outer wall, falling 2 or 3 storeys at a time and barely grasping hold of the railings of each level as I fell.<br><br>I eventually came upon an apartment that had a small hole in its wall and through that hole there were 2 people hiding under a bed. They were extremely thin and looked like lollipops. It was very unsettling to see them. They were apparently some kind of illegal immigrants, hiding in someone else's apartment to avoid the cops. They then began to lament how thin they were and that they hadn't eaten a single thing in months. They cried in a shrill voice and I woke up.</div></main>
