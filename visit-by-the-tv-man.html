<div class="post-body">07-25-2025<br><br>I was outside next to my car and talking with my sister. The sun was getting low, and the sky was overcast so it was getting dark fast. Suddenly, a black minivan pulls in to the driveway, and a couple gets out. They both looked Mexican and had black hair. The man was wearing sunglasses, so I could not see his eyes. The woman was wearing a large brimmed hat, and must have had her hair tied up within it. Both had dark hair and tanned skin. Neither of them look familiar.<br><br>The man, in Spanish, says he's here to deliver a TV. I ask him who he is, and he doesn't answer the question. Instead he steps back, opens the rear door, and pulls out a TV box that is either empty, or that he can easily move with one hand. He sets the box down and just looks at me. I ask again who he is, and he nods to the woman. The woman then rapidly walks to our front door, opens it, and enters the house. The man says and does nothing, as if he's waiting for something.<br><br>I go to the front door myself and my sister follows. From the doorway I can see the woman standing in our living room, where it's dark as we hadn’t turned the lights on yet. She is also standing there as if waiting for something. I tell her to get out, but she does not move or say anything. I look back to the man, and he hasn't moved. I tell my sister to get in her car and leave, but she doesn't.<br><br>I tell the woman again that she has to leave, or I will call the cops. Again, she does nothing. I bring my phone out, and dial 911. I get answered by a bot, of all things. It tells me to describe the emergency, and then, after a pause, to describe the people involved. I do so amd the man removes his sunglasses as if to help. He had a long face, appeared to be in his mid 40s, and was about my height. The woman was also in her mid 40s, and the only other feature I could make out in the dark was.. her chest was well defined (I didn't tell the phone bot this). She was also my height. The phone then hangs up after I described the two.<br><br>After some time, my father arrived, spoke to the man (their first time meeting it seemed, and took the TV box inside. Then I woke up.<br></div></main>
