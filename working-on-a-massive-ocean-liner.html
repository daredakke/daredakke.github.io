<div class="post-body">02-14-21<br><br>Dreamt I worked on a massive ocean liner the size of Manhattan Island in the ship's engine bay. I had to go down many levels of the ship. Each were like an entire mall filled with shops. Then I was given a custom fitted suit to wear since the engine bay was really hot and the air hazardous somehow (not because of gas or contamination). Then I attended a shift change that was overly complex for the sake of vanity (though not necessary to attend so long as you show up before the shift starts). Then I walked through the foyer of the engine bay which had a lot of rooms including but not limited to: a blast furnace door, the room leading to the engine bay, a warehouse with a crew of forklift drivers.<br><br>The room leading to the engine bay had a massive machine with what looked like a metal timing belt on it. While running the belt would get red hot and it was impossible for anyone to enter or leave the engine bay as it blocked the entrance (it had to since it was massive and needed to be right there due to the way the ship was built). The belt was removed and repaired/replaced twice a day which is when shift changes occur. I started my shift and the air began to heat up fast. It wasn't bad at all because of the suit and respirator I was given, which were excellent at keeping me cool. It was my first day so I spent it getting familiar with the engine bay while some lady gave me a tour. The whole area was massive, about the size of a factory. I helped a bit with some minor tasks involving power tools. I guess I was to help where needed. I had a locker in the engine bay for some reason. The shift ended and we went through the shift change procedures.<br><br>I rested and the lady invited me to meet someone of authority on the ship with her. Having nothing to do I accepted. This is when I saw all the shops. We went down almost to engine level before we got to the office of the person we were meeting. They were an HR-ish lady. She said something about an award for the crew of the ship with a great prize. The HR lady said she was going to give it to my supervisor (the woman who gave me the tour of the engine bay and the rest of the ship), but thought it would boost enrollment rates if she gave it to the new guy (me) instead. My supervisor completely agreed with her without hesitation. Afterwards we went our separate ways and I explored the ship on my own. The halls all looped around the edges of the ship with stairs/escalators every couple 100 meters. It seemed like the part of the ship I explored was an entire university, and that was only one set of levels.<br><br>Eventually I realized I forgot something In my engine bay locker so I decided to go get it. I put my suit on and headed to the engine bay. This was the part I found out about the timing belt blocking the only entrance. I opened the door to the engine bay and saw the metal timing belt running while red hot. I was hit with an extremely hot blast of air. I thought I could squeeze through a gap in between the timing belt and the wall but I didn't want to risk getting my suit snagged on it which would definitely kill me. After I left and closed the door I found someone in the foyers warehouse and asked them if there was a way into the engine bay. He said that the timing belt path was the only way in or out, and why the bay was inaccessible most of the day. I knew there was no fire issue from this as absolutely nothing could possibly burn in the engine room for some reason.<br><br>Next day, I showed up and while I was putting on my suit I noticed the mask to my respirator was broken and wouldn't make a seal. I told my supervisor and she told me these things break all the time. (Looking closer at these masks, I noticed they were n95 masks with what looks like a metal grate in them). She gave me a new one and said that though it isn't the one custom fit for me it would do the job. This is when I wondered about why I needed it. (Must be from the hot air. Bet that's not good for the lungs, I thought.)<br><br>In the engine bay now I was helping my supervisor move some boxes around. She asked me the time and I said 05:32. She looked confused cuz it was supposed to be 3 PM or so. I told her that my watch was on the 24 hour setting, and switched it back. When I set it back I noticed it still read 5 in the morning. Then I woke up and it was just barely 6 in the morning. That would mean the ship was somewhere in the Indian Ocean or Arabian Sea.</div></main>
