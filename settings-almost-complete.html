<div class="post-body">I've been working very slowly on the settings menu and some other bits and pieces. It's not particularly interesting so I ended up procrastinating pretty hard.<br><br>Options include changing resolution and fullscreen/window mode, FOV, look sensitivity and music/sound volume. I also added a feature that preserves the width of the dialogue box when you interact with things no matter the screen size since that isn't done automatically.<br><br>Now I just need to add support for translations (which shouldn't be that hard) and I can start making a game out of it. I wrote down a few ideas for levels last night and a basic plot outline. I had something extensive planned before but there's no way I'm going to manage that, best to stick to something simple otherwise I'll be here forever.</div></main>
