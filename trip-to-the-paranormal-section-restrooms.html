<div class="post-body">10-16-2025<br><br>I was walking around the town around sunset/dusk. For some reason, I decided to enter a school, which was taken as a police headquarters of some kind. Inside, I met an old friend of mine, and we caught up. They were investigating the sudden paranormal properties of the school. He wouldn't elaborate any further than that despite my attempts to question him. He invited me to stick around for a while, but was soon called away for some task he was needed for. I wasn't allowed to follow him, so he told me to stay put and wait for him, as he would return 'soon'.<br><br>Some time passed, and I had to use the restroom. I approached the only seemingly unoccupied officer, some woman, and asked her where they were. She urged me to just leave and go elsewhere, but I informed her that I was on the verge of having suddenly warm and wet pants. We both knew that this school has the only publicly usable restroom in a 2 mile radius. So she relented and informed me the nearest restrooms were in the paranormal section of the school and that I would need to be escorted by her.<br><br>She had me prepare by removing my shoes, and wear 'whatever religious material that applies' to me. I chose a rosary. The entrance to the paranormal section of the school was the old gymnasium. Upon going through the doors, nothing at all was familiar. Instead of a gymnasium, there was an extremely dilapidated school hallway interior. Rusted lockers, boarded up windows with window units still attached and also rusting. Rotted floor planks and the ceiling tiles had fallen and exposed the roof supports. At no point, could I see outside. Though, for some reason, the 'original' lighting/wires seemed to work.<br><br>There was a short staircase climb to my left leading to another branch of the hallway. The officer told me to go up and stick to the left to reach the restrooms, and not to wander off for any reason. She could not follow me beyond the initial entrance. She told me to make some noise along the way so that she knew I was still alive.<br><br>Making my way, I began to whistle the main OST of Corpse Party. I was sad she didn't recognize the tune. Going into the other branch, I noticed it turned into a sort of bridge over a large empty section, like a large catwalk. Along the borders of the empty space, I saw a group of figures on a balcony of sorts making their way in the opposite direction I was headed. Examining them further revealed that it was a sort of expedition force with lots of flash lights illuminating the area around them. They did not notice me and kept their course. The rest of the branch was a straight path until it branched out to the left again. After another short set of steps were two sets of doors. I figured these must be the restrooms, and wondered which were the male and female ones. Then I woke up.<br></div></main>
