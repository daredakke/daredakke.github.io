<div class="post-body">I'm playing a strange surreal 3D adventure game where I control a small female character. The MC is a creative looking for a break and goes on holiday for a while. She finds herself in a monochrome hotel room with a very tall ceiling and various pieces of furniture that are way too tall or wide. There is a fissure in the south wall opposite the desk in place of a window. It's raining hard outside.<br><br>I can interact with various speech bubbles around the room for commentary and ones with an exclamation mark in them advance the story. I learn she has an additional goal which is to create some kind of game or interactive experience. She eventually builds one but it takes a while as the story bubbles appear periodically and aren't always easy to find. She gives the game a name, but it doesn't make any sense nor can I remember it.<br><br>Now she has left the hotel room and is in a maze of corridors and rooms that are connected in an arbitrary manner. Part of it looks a bit like a hospital, others like a hotel, and the north-western part seems to be US government offices. There are all kinds of NPCs wandering about the place. She moves around the level (controlled by me) where many of the NPCs run from her but I'm not sure why they're scared. She starts picking up objects in the level and whacking NPCs over the head to kill them, they usually go down in one hit. Some of them have been raving about some kind of new disease that's going around but I don't learn much more.<br><br>After dealing with the nurses in the part of the level that looks like a hospital, she moves to the US government offices and starts stealthily ambushing secret service agents dressed in black suits and sunglasses. They have no idea what's going on.<br><br>One room is a bit different. It is a fairly large kitchen with no walls on a small island in a river nestled in a large city with skyscrapers on all sides. It's kind of dark but lit from somewhere. A film director stands in the middle wearing a black suit jacket over a black shirt and jeans. He doesn't have much hair.<br><br>She picks up a nearby bench and brings it down on his head but it doesn't seem to do much besides stagger him. He was trying to greet her but this has interrupted him. He then pulls out a frying pan from a cabinet and places it on a cooker. Is he about to try cooking something? She takes the frying pan and repeatedly smacks him over the head with it, but again it doesn't kill him, just staggers him. It seems like he's trying to talk to her the whole time.<br><br>She stops hitting him and it appears he has some kind of revelation, though I'm not sure about what. He mentions that someone called "Shizuha" will be happy and he thanks the MC for opening his eyes.<br><br>Now we're on a bridge in the same city, it doesn't seem far from the kitchen. There are ruined cars blocking one end. The bridge is all beat up with combat damage like you might expect from a warzone with fire and smoke here and there. A tall gas-mask wearing serial killer / warrior is standing nearby. Apparently he's been helping the MC since the maze from earlier. I sort of remember some kind of other presence back then but it's not all clear.<br><br>There is a bizarre mass of flesh that is a computer the MC uses. It's a tall blob of flesh that tapers near the top to a lotus flower of tentacles with some kind of optic in the centre. The MC looks through this like you would a microscope with the tentacles pulling back wider as she does. There are various thin tentacles further down. They are sort of wiggly as they come out of the mass of flesh before pulling into a tight, spring-like spiral, then they go completely straight. They're quite long. The MC grabs one and moves it like a joystick to change what she's seeing up top.<br><br>It appears the game she developed had the side-effect of making people go blind which was the disease mentioned earlier and the computer let her check it's progress as it spread. The point was to get people to stop desiring shiny trinkets (so says the MC). I interpret the game as a commentary on the dangers of rampant consumerism.</div></main>
