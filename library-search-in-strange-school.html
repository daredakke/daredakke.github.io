<div class="post-body">12-12-23<br><br>I was in a school classroom during a study period. The school was not like any I had ever been to. It had six floors and extremely long corridors and nothing else. It was essentially just a perfect rectangle. I was on the 4th floor.<br><br>At some point I decided to leave the class and go to either the chemistry lab or the library, I'd decide on the way to the stairs. After I left the classroom I decided to look for the chemistry lab on the sixth floor. I went to the stairs nearest to me and climbed up. When I made it to my floor, I walked down the entire corridor but could not find the chemistry lab. I thought ‘well fuck me I guess. I'll just go to the library.’<br><br>The library was on the lowest floor which should have been the first floor. I was far from the stairs I used so I decided to use the other stairs despite there being a classroom I had to walk through to get to the stairs at the very end of the corridor. I entered, excused myself from the in-session class, and walked past the front of the classroom. The teacher lady was not angry at me but rather started to look very worried. She excused herself from her students and followed me to the stairs. At the door to the stairwell there was a sign that read ‘NO TRAINING’ As well as some caution tape stuck on the door that had blue and white diagonal stripes. I half thought that this might not be a good idea but continued anyway.<br><br>As I descended down the stairwell, I periodically looked back at the teacher following me. Each time her face grew more and more worried, as if she wanted me to stop going down. Despite this, she would not say anything to me. Once I reached the third floor she dialed someone on her phone and very quietly told the recipient that I was going all the way down this specific stairwell. At this point I recalled that almost nobody used this stairwell for some unknown reason. She listened and hung up when we reached the top of the first floor, where she stopped following me.<br><br>I noticed that the stairs continued downward below the first floor. This made me curious so I decided to do some exploring. The stairs from this point on were different. There were no lights or even light fixtures installed, so the only light available was the fading daylight. The stairs themselves were made of large stone squares that half sat on the one below and next to the next so that one of the two forward most corners would be the next step lower. After about three flights of these stairs they ended, and the stairwell was completely dark. I lit up my phone’s flashlight and saw a set of heavily rusted double doors. Upon finding they were unlocked, I entered the corridor.<br><br>The corridor was similar to the sixth floor corridor except that it was extremely dilapidated. The doors were rotted or decayed with broken windows. The ground was covered in large rusted bolts. This corridor was vastly longer than any other level of the above ground school and grew more and more cluttered the further I went down. The rusty bolts on the ground steadily became larger and larger until I started coming across some as large as my arms. I decided to end my exploration and turned back and resume my search for the library on the first floor. When I turned around, however, I was met with a wall of rusty and extremely large bolts that had appeared directly behind me that was blocking the way back to the stairs. Then I woke up.</div></main>
