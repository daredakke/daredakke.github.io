<div class="post-body">12-06-24<br><br>I was on a tour where we stopped in London for some reason. While there, a friend and I came across a humanoid woman that was not of our species while on a trail hike. She explained that she was the sole surviving member of her people, and was over 35,000 years old. She had traveled to London from what is now Vietnam in hopes that a famous doctor she had heard of could help nurture her unborn fetus that was 35,000 years old.<br><br>The hominid (she had no name and refused to be referred to by one) was of vibrant yellow skin with black patches. She was maybe knee height to the average person. Coiled around her shoulder as if she were carrying wire, her extremely long and sturdy umbilical cord, the end of which was tattered and had a sickly green tinge to it compared to the rest of the coil/skin. She wore some makeshift clothes made of spun fiber or some similar material. Her species' females kept their umbilical cords for their lives, as that is where their wombs are located.<br><br>For the past 35,000 years, the hominid had remained undiscovered while managing to lurk on the outskirts of Vietnamese settlements to learn whichever language was spoken at the time, eventually also picking up English. This entire time, she had been trying to nurture her fetus, but has not had much success in doing so due to her not having other members of her species to help her. Her partner had gotten her pregnant long after every other member of her species had died out, and soon died himself.<br><br>We got her to the doctor she desired, and were told to check back at the clinic in a day or two while they helped/studied the hominid. Upon doing so, the hominid explained that her fetus had been long dead. She was glad to finally have closure and know for certain. She showed us the amputated portion of her umbilical cord, now preserved in a jar of glycerine. The end was still a sickly green. The insides of the amputated end of the cord revealed what looked like a threaded, tapered segment of small pipe. When we asked, the hominid explained that she would routinely come across the sudden new materials humans made in very recent (to her) times and believe them to be divine materials. She would then insert them into the end of the umbilical cord in hopes that they would help her fetus grow.<br><br>She then pointed out a plastic cutout of my friend's name that she embedded into the inner wall of the cord while following us shortly before she revealed herself to us. (My friend was paranoid that we would get lost on a small marked trail in a heavily toured area. Because of this, she used a 3d printer to make several connected plastic letters that spelled her name and occasionally dropped them on the ground behind us so that we would know where we came from.) Then I woke up.</div></main>
