<div class="post-body">I was at home browsing steam when I realise it was soon time for me to take a shower. So I told my grandma to buy games for me while I shower. After the shower, I come back to my pc and decide to see what games grandma bought. When I go in my library I see that she just bought one bundle that was full of blank games, no name, no description, no picture, nothing.<br><br>I tried launching the games but most of them won't even boot, but on my 4th or so attempt I manage to get a game running. As soon as it launchs my perspective changes to be the one in the game. It appears I teleported inside of it.<br><br>I was in a weird body position, rolled over on my shoulders with my waist above me (kind of a self-blowjob position...) and had some inertia which forced me to roll over. Once I get back on my feet, I realise this is some kind of barbie game and I became one (without the whole pink/plastic aesthetic, the colors and materials where normal). I looked at my hand and saw that I had a girl hand with long nails (not absurdly long, just normal long girl nails).<br><br>When I raised my head to see what was in front of me, I saw that I was standing in the victorian front yard of a 3 floors house/manor with a Porsche 911 parked next to it.</div></main>
