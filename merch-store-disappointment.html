<div class="post-body">I'm at a place that due to dream logic I know is supposed to be selling Shimeji Simulation merch, but they only sell pens and what's worse is that only some of them are even SS themed, most are regular pens and a couple of them are just pens with a little mushroom or fish logo. I was feeling really disappointed in the dream because I had gotten my hopes up and was expecting shirts and figures and overall something cooler.<br><br>As I'm browsing the pens in disappointment the girl I had a crush on in high school walks by, but I don't talk to her and she does not notice me. So I pretend I did not see her and I just keep browing the pens. I don't buy any of them and then I wake up.</div></main>
