<div class="post-body">04-17-24<br><br>During a family trip, we stopped at a restaurant. While we were waiting for the meals to arrive, I wandered off and was unable to find my way around the building properly. In fact, the entire building seemed to be some kind of non-euclidean construction that would change before my eyes. At some point I found myself in a room with green walls that appeared to change layout depending on where I stood. It appeared similar to how an infinite mirror illusion does, with the entryway I came in from repeating itself on the far corner of the room. I couldn't seem to escape the room since either passage would disappear when I approached. After a lot of escape attempts, I gave up and sat myself down next to a wall of the room, which made the room's walls seem like they only just barely surrounded me.<br><br>After some time, another person appeared in the room right next to me. Apparently I had sat down right next to the entryway. It was the restaurant manager. He was on his way to get some supplies. I asked him if he knew what this place was and if he had an idea on how to get out, to which he said yes. The manager explained that the building he bought for his restaurant ended up having a spatial tear in one of the rooms which caused the extremely unusual layout. Since he didn't know what could possibly be done by this, he just decided to use the anomaly for extra storage space, and that he even lives in one of the spaces in the anomaly sometimes.<br><br>He then began apologizing, hoping I hadn't been trapped here for long. We started walking, with him leading me back to the restaurant. On the way there, he explained that the door in the actual restaurant that led to the spatial tear room was temporarily taken down since it was ugly. The reason he hadn't put up a new one is because each time he takes measurements of the frame, they do not line up with the measurements of the door he took down. Even attempts to just install a door with the same dimensions as the ugly door, or even the ugly door itself, result in the door being either too wide or too narrow. A similar thing happens when he tries putting up a sign on the wall next to the entryway to mark the room as the spatial tear room. The entryway somehow moves itself away from the point, while also not moving. Upon reaching the exit of the tear, I woke up.</div></main>
