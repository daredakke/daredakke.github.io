<div class="post-body">11-22-23<br><br>I was laying down on a sofa in my living room, chilling with the dogs. Suddenly some random guy about my age comes into the room from within the house. He has a tan that almost looks like a sunburn, but just barely isn't. Then he starts speaking in an angry tone about topics that make zero sense. I do not remember what the rant was about.<br><br>Eventually his rant leads to his conclusion about how his problems will be solved once he injects his ‘superhero serum’ that he procured. As he says this, he takes out a syringe and a labeled glass container filled with a bright red liquid from a small wooden box. He then starts to draw the liquid into the syringe, filling it up completely. As he does this I am just confused and watching him do his thing saying nothing since it was entertaining to watch. At this point it seems like he does not really seem to notice I'm even there.<br><br>The novelty quickly wore off when he violently threw the syringe out of frustration from not knowing how to actually inject himself. It bounced off whatever surface it struck and somehow ended up in my left tricep. I yelled in pain and instinctively moved to get up. This was a mistake as the movement of my arm ended up plunging the entire contents of the syringe into my arm and jamming the needle deep into my arm, causing even more pain.<br><br>At this point the crazy man had left the room.<br><br>Astonished, I pulled the syringe out of me and saw that it was empty. My arm was burning with pain at this point. I stumbled over to the TV stand where he left the box he brought the syringe and the liquid in, and examined the glass container. It turns out the schizo had planned to inject himself with lacquer. I took a closer look at the chemical ingredients section of the lacquer container and immediately saw that it contained mostly pyridine. At this point I thought I was a dead man walking since I knew pyridine is extremely and used to make extremely effective pesticide. I then started looking at how to treat pyridine poisoning. I recall seeing the actual correct chemical structure on Google before waking up. Upon waking up, my arm did not hurt in the slightest.</div></main>
