<div class="post-body">I had a dream about a time-traveling action movie about preventing a shit comedy movie to be produced<br><br>From what I remember, I was an actor in a comedy movie that was recorded in the 1400's. There was me, one girl and one dude in a floating wooden hut. After some time recording the movie, we realised that it would be a comedic failure and a terrible thing to happen to mankind. So we went to the royal court to talk with the royalty and my sister that was producer of the movie about it but they refused to cancel it.<br><br>The girl, the boy and me (who I find out to be nobles) traveled in time to my current house, took a lot of my personal stuff in a backpack (stuff I didn't want to lose like my DS and games) and searched behind the TV, behind the TV there was a hole, in which there was a light switch that did nothing.<br><br>Anyway after searching for a potential royalty crest of my family (and failing), the royalty and my sister got transported into the house with us, they ran away outside and we 3 pursued them. There are apartments in front of my house and for some reason a swarm of kids aged 7-14 helped us chase them.<br><br>After a relatively long chase we ended up catching them, and at that moment my sister determined to not let me win decided to shoot herself with an AK-47, I didn't care since I could travel in time freely. Then I woke up.</div></main>
