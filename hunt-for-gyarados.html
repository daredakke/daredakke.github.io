<div class="post-body">02-22-24<br><br>One day, an actual Gyarados appeared in the world as if by magic. Everyone in the world was baffled. Nobody had been successful in their attempts to apprehend it. I had been riding with a submarine crew for a couple days now, ever since I ‘hired’ them to take me to catch the actual Gyarados. By ‘hired,’ I mean I had paid them to let me on the submarine since the creature was spotted along their normal trade route. The crew had not been easy to get along with as they loved to pull rather frustrating pranks on me, such as turning the hot water supply for the showers off mid shower.<br><br>During the final port visit before we made our way to the Gyarados’s home, I visited a private aquarium. The aquarium itself was built into someone’s residence, with the kitchen’s walls even being lined with windows into some tanks teeming with saltwater and freshwater tanks filled with exotic fishes. The displays even include mammals such as otters and platypuses. Then there was the underground portion of the ‘house.’<br><br>At the back end of the home/aquarium, there was an elevator. It only had three options, the surface, middle, and bottom. Though, going from either end to the other, it was required to stop in the middle section. The ride to the middle section alone was about 10 minutes long, and it was a fast elevator, borderline freefalling. When the elevator stopped (which was surprisingly smooth) it opened up to a massive underground space with a massive shopping mall filled with workers and customers. While the elevator was prepared to go the rest of the way down, I took a short walk around. The flooring was covered in a carpet with multi-color stripes that ran from one end to the other, not that I could see the other end. The ceiling was extremely high up, as tall as a skyscraper. It even had a parking lot ‘outside,’ which was also carpeted. I saw no cars sitting in it. I was then informed that the elevator was ready and made my way back.<br><br>The rest of the way down was not nearly as long as the initial ride, but it was still a long ride. When the doors opened up, they revealed yet more aquarium tanks, this time built into the ocean floor itself. I realized that we were in a space built into the side of the continental shelf, looking out through extremely thick windows at the sea floor. The ‘tanks’ were just enclosures made with nets and fencing to house some deep sea fishes and creatures. Since the fishes were not used to light, most tanks were dark until we manually illuminated the spaces one at a time until we were done observing. I recall seeing a deep sea lily. After hours of walking around, it was time to head back, though I wanted to stay much longer. The elevator ride up took the same amount of time as going down did.<br><br>Once back at the submarine, the drivers set off while the rest of the crew went to sleep. The next day we were passing through two very long islands with a large and deep strip of ocean between them. The submarine had surfaced since we were nearing the area where the Gyarados had been spotted. We were surprised as one of the crew keeping watch on the surface reported seeing what looked like the creature’s dorsal fins off in the distance. It was on the other side of the island on the starboard side.<br><br>The submarine approached the coast, and anchored itself there. Me and a few members of the crew loaded a small raft and landed on the island. On our way across, the crew kept receiving feedback that the Gyarados was not moving. The crew asked me what my plan was to capture the Gyarados. I replied that I had a bear that I captured while testing out a batch of pokeballs for this purpose (pokeballs did not exist at all before I made them). They asked if it was a bear pokemon. I said it was literally just a normal bear, but that I have an abundance of spare pokeballs.<br><br>Upon making it to the beach on the other side of the island, we saw that the Gyarados had been taking a nap on the beach, with its head resting on a boulder. The rest of its body still in the water. It must have been as big as a cruiser. I threw a pokeball, which failed to capture it. This woke the Gyarados up and it started thrashing around while screeching loudly. I released my bear, which rushed at the serpent and lashed at it with its claws. This seemed to work so I threw another pokeball, which also failed. Then the Gyarados blasted apart a thin section of the island and swam through the new canal after it flooded. It was now with the submarine.<br><br>The crew got reports by the submarine that the Gyarados was on the run, and that they were preparing torpedoes and missiles to launch at it. I took one of the crew’s radios and tried convincing them to not blast the Gyrados to pieces, but received no reply. We all (even the bear) ran back to the other side of the island and saw the submarine and Gyarados. The Gyarados was swimming erratically while the submarine was trying to close the distance between them. Then I woke up.</div></main>
