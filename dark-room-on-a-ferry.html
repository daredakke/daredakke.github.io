<div class="post-body">Near me (IRL) is a site where they construct the stems of offshore windmills. I kept seeing this from different angles in the dream before I saw the platform that transports them arrive and take some away. This all happened at just before sunrise on a clear day.<br><br>Then I'm in my house which for some reason is next to a dock on the river. A large ferry has arrived to pick up guests, but not before it drops off even more. A large two-storey door opens further back and people tumble out on to the concrete. It feels like this is the same as the platform from before, but it looks different.<br><br>I'm in a bedroom facing the dock trying to keep myself hidden behind a curtain as I watch the guests waiting to board. It's January but they're dressed like it's the height of summer. One older man, bald with glasses and ashen facial hair, appears to be badly sunburned.<br><br>I decide to join them and wait on a bench to board. A little girl of perhaps 8-9 years old is fiddling with a box that she drops on my lap. It's a box of cigarette filters, but the contents resemble a colourful assortment of twisted pipe cleaners and hair ties. I suggest we split the contents of the box and the girl seems to be fine with it.<br><br>We wander the ship and find a pitch black room to explore. The girl is unsure but I have a torch to illuminate the room. It's some kind of storeroom with garage shelving and boxes containing all kinds of mundane items. We leave but return several more times. At one point I forget the torch and the door closes on us, but a desk lamp at the other end of the room remains on from a previous trip. I don't know if we found anything of note in there.</div></main>
