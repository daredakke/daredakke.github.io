<div class="post-body">In my dream, I had discovered a subreddit called r/newwords. The idea behind this sub was that people posted new words they had come up with and wanted people to use (I just looked it up and apparently this sub does exist and is very small. Weird.). The post I found read as follows:<br><br>Word: Oikioe (Noun)<br>Definition: Fritters<br><br>Followed by a lengthy paragraph of how he had taken to calling fritters “oikioe” and everyone else should follow since it was a better word. The post had 0 upvotes, and the only comment was “Cramming!” by a guy who was trying to make “cramming” mean “cool”. It was so stupid that I woke myself up laughing.</div></main>
