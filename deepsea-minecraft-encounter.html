<div class="post-body">10-07-24<br><br>I was playing Minecraft with <a href='peppersauce.html' target='_blank' class='link'>Pepper</a> and some others around the time I started my server. Everything went as I remember until we made our way to where the village was built. In the ocean just next to the village, there was a massive hole similar to the one I'm currently digging on the seafloor. All of us thought this must be some insane terrain generation, so we decided to explore it despite being still very under-equipped.<br><br>Upon diving into the hole, we saw that it went way down past deepslate level. Shortly after the deepslate started, however, the hole was completely dry as there was a layer of signs holding back the water above. All of us were running out of air so we had no choice but to drop down. Thankfully, there was a layer of water in the center of the hole's shaft to break our falls. The hole was also decorated with all the necessities of a player's base.<br><br>The walls of the hole at the bottom were made of yellow concrete with patterns of green concrete. The hole's shaft itself seemed to only be a temporary base, as all around the hole were passages of natural blocks leading to empty rooms with only the floors partially finished with concrete blocks. We all explored the rooms together before eventually coming across a strip mine's entrance room.<br><br>While exploring the strip mine, we were approached by a player that was not part of the group that spawned in with us. This was extremely unusual as I had just started the server just barely an hour ago. He had a skin that was all yellow except for his torso, which was green. I tried talking to him, but received no reply. At least, no in-game reply. He answered me by directly speaking inside my head. I do not remember what he said. He then attacked one of our group. We tried to fight back, but he managed to kill the player he initially attacked. Immediately, I forgot everything about the member of our group that was killed. Asking Pepper, he said he didn't know any details about them either. Only that there was definitely one less player in our group than we spawned in with. Our fellow player did not respawn. The yellow player said something to us all again, though I am not sure what. Regardless, he just stood there and watched us.<br><br>Not knowing what to do, I tried kicking him from the server, but that did not work. I then went into creative mode and tried to kill him. He fought back and was somehow damaging me. I stopped fighting him after he hit me many times and ran. Pepper ran with me too. I spawned us some elytra and we flew out the hole. Neither of us looked back to see if the yellow player was following us.<br><br>After we were out, we made it to the coast. The yellow player did not follow us, it seemed. We then played normally until the point where the village looks as it does now. I wanted to go back to look for the yellow player, and set out alone to find it. The hole was gone from its original spot. I found it far inland in the middle of the lake. It otherwise looked exactly the same. While descending, I woke up.</div></main>
