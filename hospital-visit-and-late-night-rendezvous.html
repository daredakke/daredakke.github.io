<div class="post-body">12-30-24<br><br>I was horribly sick and waiting in a hospital's urgent care reception area. Once it was finally my turn, I was taken to a room where I spoke with a reception nurse. She asked me what I was visiting for, to which I said bad abdominal pain and nausea. Upon hearing this, she seemed to understand and mentioned a really bad virus going around. She then asked me if I was having pain "back there" I said yes. She wrote that down too and left the room, saying she'd be back with the actual doctor.<br><br>Minutes later, the two returned and asked more about the pain "back there". I described it and upon finishing the doc said she was gonna prescribe an oil with painkillers/anesthetic in it that I am to apply with a rod. Seeing that the idea put me off, she assured me that this was the only way to stop the bowel/abdomen pain due to how this virus works. She finished off by saying that I am more than free to keep suffering if I choose not to. She made the prescription for the oil and an anti nausea medication and sent me on my way.<br><br>I had left the extremely confusing hospital campus (there were only one-way roads leading into the campus and towards the main building) and headed towards the pharmacy. I parked a bit away from the pharmacy and was going to walk the rest of the short way. Almost as soon as I exited my car, I ran into zako and <a href='monax.html' target='_blank' class='link'>monax</a>. They said they were on their way to a room that they rented out for the night and invited me to join. I said I could join for a bit and followed them.<br><br>Once we got to the room, zako and monax started to take their clothes off and I kinda started to panic. I asked what exactly we were doing, to which they asked me "isn't it obvious?" I just stood there stunned as they took off more and moved towards each other, asking me to join in already. Then I woke up.<br><br>(I'm not gay I swear)</div></main>
