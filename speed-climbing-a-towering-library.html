<div class="post-body">I was in this 30-storey library with a glass roof. It was cylindrical with books covering the walls with all kinds of halls leading off from the centre. It was a rather bright environment, the building itself was pure white and the sky was a clear blue beyond the atrium's glass roof that was a dome divided into six sectors.<br><br>Each level surrounding the atrium had a chest high railing. The highest level had a much higher ceiling and had no books. There was open space on each side and I think some gardens dotted here and there.<br><br>For some reason, my goal was to get to the top as fast as possible. I discovered you could place objects into the world kinda like Gmod and if you stood on top of an item you could quickly transport yourself to the top, but there was a limit to how high you could go by riding an object, so you had to jump and climb up the side.<br><br>Once near the top, I remember looking down and not being bothered by the height at all.<br><br>In retrospect, I think the library was inspired by the one depicted in <a href='https://anidb.net/anime/7719' target='_blank' class='link'>Gosick</a>.</div></main>
