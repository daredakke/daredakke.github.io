<div class="post-body">I was in a town with narrow streets with this large building with wooden walls painted blue towering above its surroundings. It was like several houses were intersecting each other as it rose up. But I wasn't here for this.<br><br>Some friends and I had heard about a strange mansion near the edge of town and how it was supposed to be haunted. It was a lot simpler in form than the previous building with 4 floors and a simple boxy shape. There was a large garden separating it from the town and it sat on a rise giving good views of the surrounding area.<br><br>We made several trips here but nothing of note ever happened, save for a strange beast I'd sometimes come across in the streets that began paying closer attention to me with each encounter. The first time it was simply lying down and I couldn't tell what it was, but it turned out to be a unicorn the second time when it looked at me.<br><br>Later, I found myself in the town completely alone. I couldn't find anyone else at all and something was off with the world. The sky was a rusty green and much of the colour was gone from everything below. I looked around the mansion and noted how a sculpture in the lobby had mysteriously changed since the last time I was here. Back into the streets, I encountered the unicorn lying down in the road. It was large enough to block the entire way past. Near it lay the corpse of a horse missing its legs and head. The unicorn got up and stared directly at me with pure white eyes, it seemed angry. Its skin was a very dark grey and its presence made the air boil. It lowered its horned head and charged towards me.<br><br>I woke up and started recording the dream on my computer. It felt like there was some meaning behind what happened. I had written a paragraph when everything went pitch black for about 10-15 seconds. It's not normally this dark at night. When the power returned, various programs restarted on the computer and I was annoyed to have to re-organise everything. I remember speaking to my mother in the kitchen about it later.<br><br>Then I was in my old room in my mother's house. There was strange writing on the wall, some of it kanji I recognised. The walls were dark blue but this new writing was red or white on black. The right side of the wall was damaged and you could see exposed brickwork. My brother was there and we ended up arguing as he was being really annoying, like he was deliberately trying to make me angry. The state of the wall must have been his doing.<br><br>Now I'm at a house in the country. It's close to the mouth of a river near the sea. I can see the place from above including all the surrounding fields and occasional house. It's bright, vivid and green. Then I realise I'm looking at a large map on the wall in the house of how the area used to look around 50 years ago. The proprietress is talking to me about the history of the area and shows me a diagram of how local fields would be flooded in a certain way using water from the river to make them more fertile.<br><br>A friend of mine arrives while she's showing me this, I think he has a cake with him. Now my high school classmates are here, it seems I'm on a field trip and I'm trying to pack my bag while something unpleasant is showing on the television but no-one seems to be bothered by this. It makes me really uncomfortable and I soon leave in a hurry, my friend following after a moment.</div></main>
