<div class="post-body">09-25-23<br><br>I was sitting in my old bedroom which looked as it had ages ago when it had blue walls and a bunk bed for me and my brother. The T.V. was on, but I was not paying attention to it in the slightest. Instead, I was spacing out and looking at the walls. Nobody else was home at the time. Eventually I decided to take a look at the forecast on my phone and saw that the following day, Tuesday, would be the first of a three-day 'red-shifted sun event'. The picture of the sun weather apps usually use was shaded red and dark orange, and had no beams coming out of it. Additionally, the red days were forecast, in my area, to have much lower temperatures of around 53F on Tuesday to 20F on Thursday. The temperature was currently 83F. Lastly, all three days were officially labeled as 'Solar Radio Wave Burst' to describe the weather event.<br><br>When I investigated the news about this solar anomaly, I read that this is an unfathomably rare phenomenon that stars sometimes undergo. So rare that it was thought to be only ever recorded occurring on our star once in antiquity, and thus dismissed as a mere story. For a short period of time, stars sometimes start radiating vastly more radio waves instead of any other type of energy. Any light waves given off are red because that's the color closest to radio waves. Now, because red light has less energy than the sun's normal emitted light, this causes the starâ€™s heat output to be drastically reduced. This in turn reduces the habitable zone around the star, which finally causes global temperatures on Earth to fall very quickly.<br><br>The news also covered the expected global impact showing vastly colder weather to come across all regions on the planet. A news anchor was describing and explaining a map of the world and the expected temperature drops across the globe to come in the following days, with a twice-a-day level of detail for all three days. The entire daytime sky was predicted not to be blue, but instead a light orange/red. It would be like a perpetual dusk during the daytime hours. The sun would actually be safe to look at for extended periods of time. East Asia was predicted to have the lowest temperatures since it would be night there while the sun was predicted to turn red. A normal sun to bring the cool night temperatures up in the morning would not rise. Though, East Asia inhabitants would know when the sun went red as it was expected that the moon would also turn a dark red throughout the red shift event. I woke up before the weather event actually started.</div></main>
