<div class="post-body">I was being shown a diorama of the solar system, seemingly in virtual reality, but I didn't have control over it. The first part involved looking at potential future outcomes of the Earth. One outcome saw the Moon neatly embedded in the Earth with the oceans covering both bodies. Another saw the Earth get close enough to the sun where everything would immediately catch fire if you were on the sun-ward side. The second part involved looking at Uranus and Neptune. They looked incredibly detailed but a bit different from how they appear in reality. Uranus had a dark-green, almost jade, blotch covering a pale green/pink surface. The blotch grew, shrank and moved around smoothly over time. Neptune was blotchy all over, from navy blue to mid-blue. I could see the number of moons orbiting both planets and their relative sizes, and I was surprised to learn that there were a number of moons/planetoids that orbited between them.<br><br>Now I was in college, reclining on a sofa at the front of a classroom while a woman spoke off to the side. She was the one presenting the diorama, except it was really just a set of slides. Her descriptions must have been so good I was able to imagine it that well. I spoke to her once the presentation was over to show my appreciation for the first part since I often thought about how the world would end.<br><br>Afterwards I needed the bathroom and walked down the corridor. Entering the facilities, I lock myself in a cubicle that reminds me of those you find on trains. It was oddly green and spacious. Once I was finished, I noticed another door leading out of the cubicle into a short corridor. The doors were wooden and painted white, and their upper half was a frosted glass window. The corridor was pale wood floorboards with some steps going down halfway along. The walls also had frosted glass windows all along the upper half. I don't know why this was so memorable.<br><br>After the corridor was a small room that was somewhere between a cupboard and a theatre prep room. Peeking through the door on the other side, I found a corridor with students walking up and down, with dark polished wood floorboards and half-wooden, half-white painted walls. It was obvious from this and various items and paraphernalia adorning shelves and walls that this place was culturally distinct from where I had come from. I now remembered that this was a Japanese primary school attached to the main primary school where I taught (somehow the college changed while I wasn't looking). Both schools were largely autonomous but they shared some of the grounds and not all students were Japanese, some local families sent their children here instead.<br><br>Continuing on, I came across a large gym hall that was a lot longer and a thinner than what you would expect. It was full of primary school students all sitting down in rows on benches and facing left. An assembly was due to begin soon. I sat near some students and talked to one girl about her experiences here which seemed positive. She enjoyed being here over here old school (the one next door incidentally). Eventually the principal arrived so I waved goodbye and left the way I came to avoid disrupting things. I passed a teacher in the theatre prep room who had his eyes closed and was repeating some mantra over and over. He didn't seem to notice me as I passed by. Leaving the bathroom, I passed the woman I had spoken to earlier. It was late now, the work day was over and light from a sunset was pouring through the windows.<br><br>Later I was reading documents on the school containing information like which students achieved the highest grades and who won competitions the previous year. I was then passing the grounds and noted to myself how there were three sports grounds, one for each school and one shared. The scene was an optimistic one with it being a clear day and lush with greenery.</div></main>
