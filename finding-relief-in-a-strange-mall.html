<div class="post-body">10-21-24<br><br>I got locked in a very tall vertical mall that completely separated itself from reality. The elevators stopped working and the stairs all became steep ramps so it kind of resembled the 2nd level of the Minecraft Parkour Civilization. For some reason all the bathrooms had disappeared too and I really had to piss. I ended up finding a secluded stairwell and took a piss there and kept doing so regularly afterwards. Days later a group of people looking for a stairwell that would lead them out (kind of like the groups in the Library of Babel looking for books that made sense) came by and were outraged that the stairwell was covered in piss since they'd have to slide down it. I woke up thankfully not having pissed myself.</div></main>
