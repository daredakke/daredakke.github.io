<div class="post-body">I was back in college and it was the night before the first day of the semester.<br><br>I thought about the places I'd have to visit now that I'm back in home, like that liquor store. I go to sleep. I woke up with a start because I slept past my first class (first two?) I rush out of bed without even having a shower and head to the professor's office. It's 11:47am - the class was at 11.<br><br>I'm living in the dorms, which is strange since I lived off campus in college. The campus is absolutely massive, some of the buildings seem like skyscrapers. I run into a couple people I knew from back then, but I ignore them since I'm in a hurry. They try to say hi. I try to take a shortcut through an alleyway, but end up in a tangled mash of twisting staircases and nearly fall off a balcony (I don't remember much here). I finally make it to the college building, one that didn't exist at my place, and head into his office.<br><br>He's sort of a gross nervous looking guy with thick glasses. He's making out with some college-aged girl with long blonde hair. I stand there waiting for him to acknowledge that I'm in there. Eventually he tries to leave with her and I finally call out to him ("oh, you were there"), explaining I'm in his class, overslept, and wanted the syllabus for the first day to review. He asks which class, but I can't remember the name, so ask if I can check the schedule on my phone. he reluctantly agrees. However, I have tons of trouble finding where my schedule on the website. I even ask him where to find it on it, and he exasperatedly shows me. It still doesn't work. I ask if he could just look up the class roster on his computer and he says no, he already shut it off. He monologues: "I don't try to garner favor", "The world has no more use for nerds", "I've accepted that no one likes me", "Even in the winter the plows throw snow on me" (his is a rehash of things he said earlier, I don't remember when).<br><br>At the point he wants to leave. I have my backpack, so I tell him looking the schedule up will be much fast on that, if he can wait a little longer. He clearly doesn't want to, but his blonde companion giggles and says to let me try. "Alright" I sit down on the floor and pull out a tablet computer and external keyboard and mouse. As it boots up three Asian people suddenly crowd around and start trying to touch the screen and move things. I shake them off "no touching!".<br><br>Before the machine even fully boots up it goes into a complicated Wi-Fi login sequence where I have to provide my school id and some password. I'm now worried, because if it need 2factor ID, I'd have to use my phone again (is it even logged into my email?). Fortunately it lets me get by with solving a weird captcha, a picture of a bunch of curvy roads and a small puppy will keep popping up at different places. You have to click on him when he shows up. I solve it quickly.<br><br>At this point a bunch of hockey players in full attire come and sit next to me. Looking up the door in front of me leads to a hockey rink and a game is going on. (keep in mind where I'm sitting is an office). I notice other people standing around as well.<br><br>I open up a web browser and try to make my way to the schedule, but I can't remember what site to go to. Finally I ask the hockey player next to me where to go, he points at the screen with hockey gloves on and gives unhelpful advice, but somehow that helps me remember. The coach comes out and yells at them to get out there, something about number ## nearly has a scholarship, go support him. They leave and the professor sits beside me. I blame how long it's taking on the captcha "ohhhhhh".<br><br>At this point I'm trying to type the URL, but my hands are shaking and over 50% of the characters are wrong. Even when the characters are "right" they turn out "wrong" like u turns into u:, or ss turns into ss with a pair of glasses or a mustache on them. I have to keep deleting and retyping. This goes on for an uncomfortably long time. With him looking over my shoulder all the while.<br><br>At this point I realize it's a dream, and I don't want to bother with this. I wake up.</div></main>
