<div class="post-body">03-18-25<br><br>I was at an airport of sorts that was shaped like a vast rectangle with a courtyard-like space in the center, where the runway was located.<br><br>The way the planes would take off was by leaving the hangars on the long ends of the airport at immense speed to quickly generate lift. Once the plane was off the ground, the pilots had to quickly shut off the jet engines and brake the plane in a way that rotated the entire aircraft to an acute angle in respect to the wall they were headed towards. This was done in a way where the tail would swing and arc downwards before reaching the final take off position. The braking process seemed to begin before the plane even fully left the hangar. The jet engines would then be fully throttled, where it was revealed that they had thrust and exhaust similar to rocket engines.<br><br>If the process was performed correctly, the plane would begin to fly upwards almost upside down until it cleared the uppermost point of the airport before the pilots spun the aircraft into an upright position and then fly the rest of the way as normal. I woke up after witnessing one takeoff.<br></div></main>
