<div class="post-body">I was walking with some other folk through a suburb of some city that looked similar to a place I used to live with 4-5 storey apartment blocks with small parks between them. Later I went to look up a street I had seen called "Saint John-Paul II Way" on Google Streetview, only to be shown a garden party taking place on the Shetland Isles during the summer solstice. It was a clear day with tables and gazebos set up on a well-cut grassy field with a good view of the sea. At least 100 popes were in attendance dressed in their white robes who all had their backs to the camera. The only food available was hamburgers.</div></main>
