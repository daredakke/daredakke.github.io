<div class="post-body">I dreamt that I was showing somebody Joe Dante’s imdb page (the director of Gremlins) and it turned out that in the past 20 years, he had made over 30 movies that were about people on planes with something scary out the window. All the posters were identical, with someone doing a Home Alone style scream at the camera on a plane with the scary thing looking in the window behind them. One was a gremlin, another Godzilla, another San, another a demon, you get the idea. None of these movies were technically related and Joe Dante got really mad if you implied that they were in any way related or derivative.</div></main>
