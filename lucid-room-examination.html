<div class="post-body">I found myself in a rundown, alternate version of my flat with dilapidated drywall lit with dim light bulbs. There was plenty of stuff everywhere, including old computers, computer parts and peripherals, books, CD cases and more. There were also a couple of boxes and tables with their own complement of junk. All the doors seemed to be missing.<br><br>At some point I realised I was dreaming, but this realisation remained fairly tucked away in the back of my mind. Instead of focusing too hard on the fact that this was a lucid dream, I took advantage of my newfound ability to look around freely and started examining the local environment more closely. I inspected many of the parts lying around as well as the CD cases and books, but I could never quite grasp what the text was saying. Either the lighting made it hard to read or I would be distracted by something else.<br><br>I could also see myself from the usual perspective, unlike many dreams where I'm simply a disconnected point of view. I was wearing an unbuttoned blue shirt over a black t-shirt with light grey jeans and grey sneakers, not too far off what I wear in reality.<br><br>It wasn't a particularly long or interesting dream, but the rarity of experiencing a proper lucid dream made it especially memorable.</div></main>
